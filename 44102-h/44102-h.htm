<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It has been a surprise and a delight to me,
as this book has been in progress, to learn of
the many different ways that people have
worked out these home credit plans. It has
been as if I could see into many happy schoolrooms.
Letters from mothers and fathers
boasting of the accomplishments of their
children, have brought to me a little glow
from the hearthsides of many homes. A
father brought his boy&mdash;or rather the boy
brought his father&mdash;up to see me and talk
over what the boy was doing at home. The
father boasted of the boy's fine garden, his
big pumpkins, his watermelons that would
attract the neighbors. Johnny almost burst
the top button off his vest with pride as his
father praised him and patted him on the
head. After this happy meeting, the father
and the son got on the high wagon seat and
rode home; and as I saw them going down
the street, I could imagine what they talked
about. Such glimpses help to make a school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
man's life worth while; and I have had many
of them as I have been writing this book.</p>

<p>For the fact that this book exists at all, I
am indebted to my wife, who has helped me
with every part of it, and to Mr. and Mrs.
C. C. Thomason, of Olympia, Washington,
who believed in the book from the first. Mrs.
Thomason has also done much work on the
book; she has gathered all the illustrative material,
visiting many schools and writing many
letters. She and my wife have done most
of the organizing of material, and have gone
over the manuscript together. To Miss
Fanny Louise Barber, of the Washington
High School, Portland, I am grateful for her
careful reading and revision of several chapters.
I owe thanks to Mrs. Sarah J. Hoagland,
of Belt, Montana, for the true and vivid
stories she has sent me; and I am thankful
to all the home credit teachers, with whom
we have been corresponding, for their painstaking
answers to our letters, as well as for
the valuable plans that they have originated.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The child is a born worker; activity is the law of his nature.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Francis W. Parker.</span>
</p></blockquote>


<p>This book is simply the narrative of the
working-out of an idea. The idea first came
to me from memories of my own home, where
tasks were assigned to us children and were
made to seem important. With my father,
the work was always carried on in the spirit
of a game, and the game could be made as
interesting as any other game; in the meantime
something was being done that was
worth while. Among many other memories
there comes one of our laying a rail fence
by moonlight, after a freshet had taken the
other fence away; when the game was to get
the line completed before the moon went
down. I can still see father laying rail on
rail, and enjoy his glowing enthusiasm at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
our accomplishment. The fence still stands.
Besides seeking to make the work interesting
in itself, father had a device to put a
value on time for his boys by giving us free
time after the tasks were completed to do as
we saw fit.</p>

<p>The desire, after I became a teacher, to
put myself in the enviable position of my
father as an inspiring influence with children,
was the motive that took my thoughts out of
the schoolroom into the homes of my pupils.
Should not the school be simply a group of
people come together for improvement, with
the teacher as their best friend, ready to
discuss and promote everything that seems
worth while? We found it easy to talk at
school about the things the children were
concerned with out of school. One spring my
pupils carried home, from our little boxes at
school, cabbage plants and tomato plants to
become members of their families for the
summer. Later we had a county school fair
for the exhibition of the children's clear jelly
and fine bread and vegetables and sewing and
carpentry. The schools were trying to recognize
"the whole child."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>This book is written in the hope that parents,
teachers, and children may be helped
to work together more joyously and harmoniously
on the real problems of life.</p>

<p>When I was teaching in the University of
Oregon in the spring of 1910, I wrote and had
published in the Oregon papers the following
article:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We all believe that civilization is founded upon
the home. The school should be a real helper to
the home. How can the school help the home?
How can it help the home establish habits in the
children of systematic performance of home duties
so that they will be efficient and joyful home helpers?
One way is for the school to take into account
home industrial work and honor it. It is my conviction,
based upon careful and continuous observation,
that the school can greatly increase the
interest the child will take in home industrial work
by making it a subject of consideration at school.
A teacher talked of sewing, and the girls sewed.
She talked of ironing, and they wanted to learn to
iron neatly. She talked of working with tools, and
both girls and boys made bird houses, kites, and
other things of interest. Recently a school garden
was planned in a city and one of the boys was
employed to plow the land. Seventy-five children
were watching for him to come with the team. At
last he came driving around the corner. <em>He</em> could
manage a <em>team</em>. He drove into the lot, and a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and fifty eyes looked with admiration at the
boy who could unhitch from the sled and hitch to
the plow; and then as he, "man-fashion,"&mdash;lines
over one shoulder and under one arm,&mdash;drove the
big team around the field, all could feel the children's
admiration for the boy who could do something
worth while. And I have seen a girl who
could make good bread or set a table nicely get
the real admiration of her schoolmates.</p>

<p>The school can help make better home-builders.
It can help by industrial work done in the school,
but as that is already receiving consideration by
the press and in a few schools, I shall not in this
short article treat of it.</p>

<p>The plan I have in mind will cost no money, will
take but little school time, and can be put into
operation in every part of the State at once. It
will create a demand for expert instruction later
on. It is to give school credit for industrial work
done at home. The mother and father are to be
recognized as teachers, and the school teacher put
into the position of one who cares about the habits
and tastes of the whole child. Then the teacher and
the parents will have much in common. Every
home has the equipment for industrial work and
has some one who uses it with more or less skill.</p>

<p>The school has made so many demands on the
home that the parents have in some cases felt that
all the time of the child must be given to the
school. But an important thing that the child
needs along with school work is established habits
of home-making. What people do depends as much
upon habit as upon knowledge. The criticism that
is most often made upon industrial work at school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
is that it is so different from the work done in the
home that it does not put the child into that sympathetic
relation with the home, which after all
is for him and the home the most important thing
in the world. Juvenile institutions find that they
must be careful not to institutionalize the child to
such an extent that he may not be contented in
a real home. In my opinion it will be a great thing
for the child to want to help his parents do the task
that needs to be done and to want to do it in
the best possible way. The reason why so many
country boys are now leading men of affairs is because
early in life they had home responsibilities
thrust upon them. I am sure that the motto
"Everybody Helps" is a good one.</p>

<p>But one says: "How can it be brought about?
How can the school give credit for industrial work
done at home?" It may be done by sending
home printed slips asking the parents to take account
of the work that the child does at home
under their instruction, and explaining that credit
will be given for this work on the school record.
These slips must be used according to the age of
the child, so that he will not be asked to do too
much, for it must be clearly recognized that children
must have time for real play. The required
tasks must not be too arduous, yet they must be
real tasks. They must not be tasks that will put
extra work on parents except in the matter of
instruction and observation. They may well call
for the care of animals, and should include garden
work for both boys and girls. Credit in school for
home industrial work (with the parents' consent)
should count as much as any one study in school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>To add interest to the work, exhibitions should
be given at stated times so that all may learn from
each other and the best be the model for all. The
school fairs in Yamhill, Polk, Benton, Lane,
Wasco, and Crook Counties, together with the
school and home industrial work done at Eugene,
have convinced me most thoroughly that these
plans are practicable, and that school work and
home work, school play and home play, and love
for parents and respect for teachers and fellow
pupils can best be fostered by a more complete
co&#246;peration between school and home, so that the
whole child is taken into account at all times.</p></blockquote>

<p>After the home-credit schools of Mr. O'Reilly
and Mr. Conklin were well under way, I received
many inquiries about the home credit
idea. As I was then State Superintendent, I
had a pamphlet printed by the State Office,
describing the workings of the plan, and had
it distributed to Oregon teachers. Fifteen
thousand copies were also printed for Mr.
Claxton, Commissioner of Education, in the
summer of 1912, and distributed by the
National Bureau to superintendents and
teachers throughout the United States. Since
this pamphlet has been out of print there
have been many inquiries sent me about
home credit, and I hope that this book may
answer some of them.</p>

<h3>MARY</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The brain and the hand, too long divorced, and each mean
and weak without the other; use and beauty, each alone vulgar;
letters and labor, each soulless without the other, are henceforth
to be one and inseparable; and this union will lift man to
a higher level.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Stanley Hall.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>The idea of giving school credit for home
work first occurred to me when I was a high-school
principal in McMinnville, Oregon, in
1901. Often, in the few years that I had been
teaching, I had felt keenly a lack of understanding
between school and home. As I was
thinking over this problem, and wondering
what could be done, I chanced to meet on the
street the mother of one of my rosiest-cheeked,
strongest-looking high-school girls. I saw
that the little mother looked forlorn and
tired. There was a nervous twitch of the
hand that adjusted the robes about the crippled
child she was wheeling in a baby buggy.
I had frequently noticed that Mary, the
daughter, who was one of the very poorest
students in her class, was on the streets the
greater part of the time after school hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I thought, "What value can there be in my
teaching that girl quadratic equations and
the nebular hypothesis, when what she most
needs to learn is the art of helping her mother?"</p>

<p>In the algebra recitation next day I asked,
"How many helped with the work before
coming to school?" Hands were raised, but
not Mary's. "How many got breakfast?"
Hands again, not Mary's. "I made some
bread a few days ago, bread that kept, and
kept, and kept on keeping. How many of
you know how to make bread?" Some hands,
not Mary's. I then announced that the lesson
for the following day would consist as usual
of ten problems in advance, but that five
would be in the book, and five out of the
book. The five out of the book for the girls
would consist of helping with supper, helping
with the kitchen work after supper, preparing
breakfast, helping with the dishes and kitchen
work after breakfast, and putting a bedroom
in order. Surprise and merriment gave place
to enthusiasm when the boys and girls saw
that I was in downright earnest. When I
asked for a report on the algebra lesson next
day all hands went up for all the problems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
both in algebra and in home-helping. As
I looked my approval, all hands fell again,
that is, all hands but Mary's. "What is it,
Mary?" I asked. "I worked five in advance,"
she replied with sparkling eyes: "I worked
all you gave us, and five ahead in the book!"</p>

<p>Since that day I have been a firm believer
in giving children credit at school for work
done at home. We did not work home problems
every day that year, but at various times
the children were assigned lessons like the
one mentioned, and scarcely a day passed
that we did not talk over home tasks, and
listen to the boys and girls as they told what
each had achieved. The idea that washing
dishes and caring for chickens was of equal
importance with algebra and general history,
and that credit and honor would frequently
be given for home work, proved a stimulus to
all the children, and especially to Mary. Her
interest in all her school duties was doubled,
and it is needless to say that her mother's
interest in the school was many times increased
as her heavy household cares were in
part assumed by her healthy daughter.</p>

<p>A few weeks after the first home credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
lesson Mary brought her luncheon to school.
At the noon hour she came to my desk, opened
her basket, and displaying a nicely made
sandwich said, "I made this bread." The
bread looked good, and must have been all
right, for she ate the sandwich, and it did not
seem to hurt her. She came again wearing
a pretty new shirt-waist, and told me she had
made it herself, and that it had cost just
eighty-five cents.</p>

<p>After Mary graduated from high school
she went out into the country to teach, and
boarded with her uncle's family. Her uncle's
wife was ill for a while, and Mary showed
that she knew how to cook a fine meal, and
how to set a table so that the food looked good
to eat. She made herself generally useful.
Her uncle came to my office one day and told
me that Mary was the finest girl he ever saw,
and that every girl like that should go to
college, and that he was going to see that she
went to college if he had to sell the farm to
send her. She went to college, but it didn't
take the farm to send her.</p>

<h3>THE SPRING VALLEY SCHOOL</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>An excellent result of the absence of centralization in the
United States.... The widest possible scope being allowed
to individual and local preferences, ... one part of our vast
country can profit by the experience of the other parts.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">John Fiske.</span></p>


<p>Kindly convey my blessing to that genius of a teacher in
Spring Valley, the same to stand good till judgment day.</p></blockquote>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Wm. Hawley Smith.</span></p>


<p>Mr. A. I. O'Reilly, in the school at
Spring Valley, Oregon, was the first to give
systematic, certified credit for home work.
He originated the idea of having a prize
contest for credits, and put care for health
and cleanliness on the list of home duties.
Dr. Winship classifies new educational suggestions
as dreams, nightmares, and visions.
The remarkable success of Mr. O'Reilly in
his home credit school should place his ideas
in the "vision" list.</p>

<p>Spring Valley is a rich farming district in
Polk County, Oregon, about nine miles from
Salem. Mr. O'Reilly took the school in the
fall of 1909. He rented a farmhouse about
half a mile away, brought his wife and little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
boys out from Dakota, where he had served
as county superintendent, and went to work
building up his school. He gained great
influence with the boys and girls, and was
much respected and thoroughly liked by
everybody.</p>

<p>He noticed that on each big, well-developed
farm in the neighborhood there was a great
deal of work for the boys and girls to do, but
that they did not as a rule do it with cheerfulness
and interest. He wanted, if possible,
to change their attitude of mind. So, with the
hearty approval of his board of directors, he
arranged to give school credit for home work.
This was in the fall of 1911. Various tasks
that the children ought to do he put into a
list, and allowed a certain number of minutes
credit for each one.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The three children having
earned the greatest number of credits at
the close of the nine school months were to
receive three dollars each, and the three next
highest, two dollars. The money was to be
allowed by the school board, and put into the
savings bank to the credit of the prize-winners.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>Every one of the thirty-three pupils
in the school was enrolled in this new kind
of contest. The registering of the credits each
morning meant extra work for the teacher,
but it brought extra results. The prospect of
a bank account for the winners incited the
children to learn for the first time something
about banks and banking. There was a "we-are-doing-something"
atmosphere throughout
the school.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SPRING VALLEY SCHOOL, OREGON, WHERE HOME CREDITS WERE GIVEN, 1911-1912</p></div>
</div>

<p>In answer to the query of some visitors if
this giving of credit for home work did not
interfere with school work, Mr. O'Reilly
pointed to the record in the county spelling
contest, in which his school had earned 100
per cent that month.</p>

<p>The county superintendent, Mr. Seymour,
had announced that a banner would be given
to his rural schools showing that they were
standard schools as soon as they should meet
certain requirements. These requirements
were well-drained school grounds; school
building properly lighted, heated, and ventilated;
schoolhouse and grounds neat and
attractive; sanitary outbuildings; walk made
to building and outbuildings; individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
drinking-cups; the purchase each year of one
standard picture; thorough work on the part
of teacher and pupils; the enrollment of every
pupil in the spelling contest; and an average
of 95 per cent in attendance. Spring Valley
was the first school in the county to receive
the banner and become a standard school.</p>

<p>The county superintendents of Oregon
were assembled at Salem in January, 1912,
for the purpose of grading teachers' examination
papers. They were much interested in
what they heard of Mr. O'Reilly's work
at Spring Valley and accepted with great
pleasure the invitation of Mr. Seymour to
visit the school. As that day in Mr. O'Reilly's
school is significant, I wish to quote an article
about it written by T. J. Gary, superintendent
of Clackamas County. Mr. Gary's article
was printed in one of the Oregon City
papers in January, 1912.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Last Saturday seventeen county school superintendents
and the superintendent of public
instruction drove through the wind and rain to
Spring Valley, Polk County, to attend a parent-teachers'
meeting. Why? Because we had heard
much of a new plan that was being tried out by
the teacher, pupils, and parents of the school in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
that beautiful valley. Did we go because it was a
new plan? No. If we should try to investigate
every new plan we would be going all the time.
We went because we thought we saw a suggestion,
at least, of a solution of two very important problems:
"How to bring the school and the home into
closer relation," and "How to make the boys and
the girls in the country love their home."</p>

<p>We arrived at the Spring Valley School at 10.30
<small>A.M.</small> and observed first a board walk from the road
to the schoolhouse door and a well-drained school-yard
free from all rubbish, such as sticks, pieces
of paper, and so forth.</p>

<p>Upon entering the room we observed that the
directors had made provision for the proper heating,
lighting, and ventilation of the schoolroom.
On the walls were three nicely framed pictures,
the "Sistine Madonna," "The Christ," and "The
Lions," all beautiful reproductions of celebrated
works of art. The building was a modest one,
much like many school buildings we find through
the country, but there was about it that which
said plainer than words can say it, "This is a well-ordered
school."</p>

<p>Looking to the right, we saw on a partition wall,
on the floor, and on the side wall, a variety of articles:
aprons, dresses, doilies, handbags, handkerchiefs,
kites, traps, bird houses, and various other
things made by the boys and girls of the school.
At the left in the other corner of the room were
loaves of bread, pies, cakes, tarts, doughnuts, and
other tempting things prepared by the girls and
boys. The writer sampled various edibles, among
them a cake baked by Master Z&mdash;&mdash;, son of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
ex-superintendent, J. C. Z&mdash;&mdash;. I can cheerfully
say that it was the kind of cake that makes a man
want more.</p>

<p>These things were all of interest to us, but the
one thing we were most curious to know about
was the system the teacher had of giving credits
for home work; not school work done at home,
but all kinds of honest work a country girl or boy
can find to do. Pupils were given five minutes
credit for milking a cow, five minutes for sleeping
in fresh air, five minutes for taking a bath, and so
on through the long list of common duties incident
to home life in the country. The rule of the school
is that any pupil who has earned six hundred
minutes may have a holiday, at the discretion of
the teacher. If the pupil asks for a holiday to use
for some worthy cause the teacher grants it, providing
it does not interfere too much with the
pupil's school work.</p>

<p>Space will not permit my giving a more detailed
account of the plan. I trust that enough has been
given to show the principle involved. The teacher
was subjected to volley after volley of questions
from the superintendents, but was able to answer
all of them with alacrity. The chairman called
upon the parents to give their testimony as to the
success of the movement. I cannot write here all
that was said, but will give two statements as
fair samples of all.</p>

<p>One good motherly-looking country woman said:
"Before this plan was started I got up in the
morning and prepared breakfast for the family,
and after breakfast saw to the preparation of the
children for school. Now, when morning comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the girls insist upon my lying in bed so that they
may get breakfast. After breakfast they wash the
dishes, sweep the kitchen, and do many other
things as well as make their own preparation for
school. I think the plan is a success. My only fear
is that it will make me lazy."</p>

<p>One father said: "I have two boys&mdash;one in the
high school and Jack, here. It was as hard work
to get the older boy out in the morning as it was
to do the chores, and as Jack was too young to be
compelled to do the work, I let them both sleep
while I did it. Now, when the alarm sounds, I
hear Jack tumbling out of bed, and when I get up
I find the fires burning and the stock at the barn
cared for; so all I have to do is to look happy, eat
my breakfast, and go about my business. Yes,
it is a great success in our home."</p>

<p>At this point Superintendent Alderman said:
"Jack, stand, we want to see you," and Jack, a
bright, manly-appearing country boy of fourteen
years stood blushing, while we looked our appreciation.</p>

<p>One man told of the many things that his
daughter had done, whereupon it was suggested
that she might do so much that her health would
be in danger. A pleasant smile flitted across the
face of the father as he said, "Daughter, stand
and let these men see if they think you are injuring
your health." A bright, buxom, rosy-cheeked
girl&mdash;the very picture of health and happiness&mdash;arose
while we laughed and cheered.</p>

<p>To the question, "Does this work interfere with
the work of the school?" the teacher pointed to
the record of the school in a spelling contest that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
is being conducted in this county, and read
"100 per cent for this month; 98.12 per cent for
last," and said, "No, I find that the children have
taken more interest in their work and are making
more progress than before."</p>

<p>When alone, after time for reflection, I thought,
"One swallow does not make a summer" and one
school does not prove that this is a good plan. In
Spring Valley the conditions are ideal,&mdash;a board
of directors who do their duty, a citizenship that is
far above the average, girls and boys from well-ordered
homes of a prosperous people, a teacher
who would succeed anywhere with half a chance,
a wide-awake, sympathetic county school superintendent,&mdash;and
yet I thought if this is good for
the Spring Valley School, might it not be a good
thing for all our schools? I have not reached a
conclusion, but have had much food for thought,
and am more than pleased with my experience and
observation.</p>

<p>What do you think about it, gentle reader? Is
it a passing fancy? A fad, if you please? Or is it a
means for training boys and girls to habits of
industry and to a wholesome respect for honest
toil? Will it bring the home and the school into
closer relation? And will it cause the country boys
and girls to love their homes, to love the country
with its singing birds, its babbling brooks, its
broad fields and friendly hills?</p></blockquote>

<p>There was not a school in the State that
responded better to any movement initiated
by the State or county than the one in Spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Valley. Every pupil was greatly interested
in the boys' and girls' industrial and agricultural
contest which Oregon carried on that
year for the first time. The children raised
cabbage plants at school, protected from the
cold by a tent that Mr. O'Reilly provided.
They planned to sell them to the neighbors
in order to get money for seeds, but were
sadly disappointed, when they came to school
one morning, to find that a cow had broken
in during the night and destroyed almost
every plant. The owner of the cow paid them
the value of the plants, but they were never
quite so happy over the fund as they would
have been if the plants had been allowed to
grow.</p>

<p>Six weeks before the end of the school year
Mr. O'Reilly began making Saturday trips
to Salem to arrange for the fair with which he
intended to close the school. The merchants
subscribed liberally for prizes both for the
children's work and for the athletic events
which Mr. O'Reilly had planned for the
afternoon. A local piano house sent out a
piano for the occasion, and an amusement
company put up a merry-go-round, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
stands for lemonade, ice-cream, and all the
rest that goes with a first-class picnic. The
picnic was held in the grove a short distance
from the schoolhouse. Mr. O'Reilly and the
neighbors had made a platform for which the
children's work formed the background,&mdash;dresses,
bird houses, fancy work, cakes,
bread, and other articles,&mdash;and had made
seats of rough lumber for the crowd. And a
crowd it was, for the whole county was interested
in the Spring Valley School. This was
one of the first local fairs in connection
with the county school fairs which were held
throughout the State, and the awards were
also to be made to the children who had
earned the most credits in the home credit
contest.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="picnic" id="picnic"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">PICNIC LUNCHEON COOKED AND SERVED BY SPRING VALLEY CHILDREN</p></div>
</div>

<p>We drove out from Salem in automobiles.
On reaching the grove we found it filled with
teams tied everywhere, and many automobiles
standing about. Promptly at ten o'clock
the school children marched down from the
schoolhouse in an industrial parade, carrying
things that they had made or raised in the
garden. A pretty sight they were, as they
took their places on the reserved benches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
front, all in their best clothes, most of the
girls in white dresses of their own making.</p>

<p>The Governor of Oregon was there, and
made the first address. At the close of his
talk, the Spring Valley children sang in voices
as clear as the birds, "There is no Land Like
Oregon," and were most heartily cheered.
After the remainder of the addresses and
songs came the most breathless part of the
day, the awarding of the school-credit prizes
for the year's work. A member of the school
board read the list of winners, and took occasion
to express the appreciation that the district
felt for Mr. O'Reilly's work. He assured
the audience that the people of the district
considered the plan one of the very finest that
they had ever known, for it put the children
in the right attitude toward their work, and
gave the parents the feeling that they were
assisting in the work of the school. Never in
the history of the community had there been
such a year.</p>

<p>The judging of the industrial work was
then carried on, while the Spring Valley home-credit
girls set the long tables for the luncheon,
which they had prepared without assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
from their mothers. We all envied the
three women up on the platform tasting the
cakes, and were glad when the ribbons were
pinned on, for we knew then that the dinner
would begin. The blue ribbon for cake-making
by children under thirteen was awarded to a
boy, Arthur Z&mdash;&mdash;. The governor and I placed
this lad between us at the head of the table,
and he gave us very generous portions of the
prize cake.</p>

<p>This was Mr. O'Reilly's last day with the
Spring Valley School. The next year he was
chosen one of the rural school supervisors in
Lane County, and he is still there making an
excellent record. A recent letter from him
briefly takes up the later history of his Spring
Valley winners in the home credit contest.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Evangeline J&mdash;&mdash; was one of the winners. She
is doing finely in high school, and still winning
prizes at fairs. She leads her class in domestic
science in the Eugene High School. She has eighty
dollars in the bank, sixty-one dollars and fifty
cents earned from prizes. You know the home
credit started her bank account with three dollars.
Golda B&mdash;&mdash; is another. She is attending the
high school at Sheridan. Her standings are fine.
She very seldom has to take examinations. She has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
about seventy-five dollars in the bank. Jack S&mdash;&mdash;
has finished the eighth grade, and is going to
attend high school in Eugene this year. His bank
account is thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents.
Mabel S&mdash;&mdash; has finished the grades and will go
to high school in Hopewell this year. Her bank
account is thirty-eight dollars. She has a piano
her father got her, and is doing well in music.
Verda R&mdash;&mdash; attends high school in Eugene this
year. The other winners are still little ones, and
are attending school in Spring Valley.</p></blockquote>

<h3>WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE ALGEBRA?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="center">
Present interest is the grand motive power.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rousseau.</span>
</p>

<p>An objection to the introduction of new subjects is that
children are already overworked in school. There is, however,
a precaution against overwork; it is making school work interesting
to the children. To introduce new and higher subjects
into the school program is not necessarily to increase the strain
upon the child. If this measure increases the interest and
attractiveness of the work and the sense of achievement, it
will diminish weariness and the risk of hurtful strain.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Charles W. Eliot.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>When I was county superintendent in
Yamhill County I used to talk much of the
home credit plan in local institutes. One day
when I was explaining how the plan worked,
and how I had given credit in algebra for
home activities, a teacher arose in the audience
and said he was willing to go almost any
length with me, but he thought it was going
too far to give credit in algebra for what was
not algebra. "Is it not dishonest?" he asked,
"and will it not teach dishonesty? Besides, if
you give credit in this way for things not algebra,
<em>what will become of the algebra</em>?" This
is an unsettled problem: what <em>will</em> become of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the algebra? True, Mary got more algebra!
I put this unsettled question alongside of
another. I was arguing for the consolidation
of schools in a little district near a larger district,
and had tried to show that consolidation
would be much cheaper, and would bring
greater advantages, when a man stood up
and said that he agreed in general with the
plan but that it would not work in this district,
"for," said he, "this district has a cemetery
deeded to it, and if the district should
lose its identity, <em>what would become of the
cemetery</em>?" As these questions are similar,
I put the algebra into the cemetery.</p>

<p>I believe in algebra, but in order to teach
algebra I believe it is first necessary to see to
it that the child is in a constructive frame of
mind. He should be in harmony with his surroundings.
When Mary became interested in
her home, she was in a mood to work problems
in advance. When her home was neglected,
her algebra problems were all in arrears.</p>

<p>Even though we omitted the consideration
of the health, the morals, and the working
ability of the pupils, the home credit system
would be justified as a part of the school work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
because of its revitalizing effect on the regular
school work. The teacher who succeeds
in touching the hidden springs of youthful
interest is doing more for humanity than
the man who discovers the much-sought-for
method of bringing static electricity out of
space. A child, or a man either for that matter,
is a dynamo of energy when interested.
Many people think that children in school
are overworked; in my opinion they are more
often underinterested. One little lad of about
five, taking a Sunday walk with grown people,
told his father that he was very tired, that
his legs fairly ached, and that he would
have to be carried or else camp right there.
A member of the party (I wish I could remember
his name, for he was a good child
psychologist) said to the boy, "Why, sure,
you don't have to walk. I'll get you a horse."
He cut a stick horse and a switch. The boy
mounted at a bound, whipped his steed up
and down the road, beating up the dust in
circles around the crowd. By the time he
reached home he had ridden the stick horse
twice as far as the others had walked, and
had not remembered that he was tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>My first trial of home credits convinced me
that children would do better school work
because of the plan. I have letters from many
teachers through the Northwest bearing me
out in my opinion. I quote: "It stimulates
to better work in school." "The teachers
notice an improvement in school work along
all lines." "It has helped to make our school,
in some respects at least, as good as any in the
county, according to the county superintendent's
own word. A member of the board says
the children have never made such progress
since the school was built, and all say these
children have never made so much progress
before." Tardiness is reported to be much
less in home credit schools.</p>

<p>A prominent Western dairyman remarked
that arithmetic had always been a hopeless
subject for him. He declared that arithmetically
he was "born short." A listener inquired
if he had any trouble in keeping
accounts, in figuring out the profits on each
dairy cow, or in doing other problems connected
with his farm. He replied very quickly,
"No, not at all. I don't have any trouble with
anything except arithmetic." Home credits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
take into account the out-of-school mathematical
activities. So the boy who has measured
a cord of wood, laid out a garden plot,
figured out the costs, income, and profits of
feeding a pig for a year, or solved any problem
that comes up on the farm, will be considered
to have done something in arithmetic.</p>

<p>From Auburn, Washington, comes a story
of the effect of giving school credits for garage
and shop work. Joe, a boy of seventeen,
who had attended high school for a year and a
half, had earned only three academic credits,
and his other work was below passing. The
superintendent, Mr. Todd, called a conference
with Joe's parents and, to use his own
expression, went after Joe "with hammer and
tongs." After much discussion, the superintendent
finally asked the father and mother
what the boy seemed most interested in outside
of school. Exchanging a troubled glance
with his wife, the father said that as soon as
Joe got out of school he rushed straight to
Meade's garage. So the superintendent went
to the garage, and found that Joe could be
taken into Mr. Meade's employment for the
afternoons. Again he called Joe to his office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and said to him, "Now, see here. You are
going on with your regular subjects here in
school, and in addition you are going to do
some work down in Meade's garage. Mr.
Meade is going to grade your work and send
in his report to me. If you make good there it
will help out your record here. You will get
pay for your work, too. You have got it in
you to make good, and I know you will. What
do you think about it?" "I think it's bully!"
exclaimed Joe.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 600px;"><a name="joe" id="joe"></a>
<img src="images/f028.jpg" width="600" height="372" alt="joe" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">JOE IN THE GARAGE, AUBURN, WASHINGTON</p></div>
</div>

<p>Joe had failed in his geometry, but as soon
as he took the position at the garage his work
in geometry improved. It was about Christmas
that he began working, and at the time
of the report several months later he was
doing well in his mathematics. The credit
he received from the garage counted toward
his marks for high-school graduation. Mr.
Meade, incidentally, was very much pleased
with his part in the transaction, and sent
in his reports with religious regularity.</p>

<p>Not only Joe, but some half dozen other
boys in Mr. Todd's school at Auburn are now
"farmed out" in this manner, and work downtown
under regular contract. They are mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
boys who had lost interest in school, and
were at the dropping-out stage. Mr. Todd's
plan is similar to the one in use at Fitchburg,
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Herbert M&mdash;&mdash;, of Minnehaha, Washington,
is such a busy boy at home that he does
not have time to look at a book after he leaves
school. This year, 1914, Mr. W. E. Dudley,
the principal of the Minnehaha school, began
to give credit for home work and allowed the
credits obtained to be applied where most
needed. The first month of school this year
Herbert's arithmetic grade was below 65 per
cent; his last month's grade in the same subject,
without adding any credits, was above
95 per cent. At first Herbert needed his extra
credits applied to his mathematics to obtain
a passing grade. But for some cause his work
in arithmetic has improved wonderfully.</p>

<p>If you care to get up at five o'clock and go
through the day with Herbert it may open
your eyes as to what an industrious boy of
fifteen does at home. He is always up early,
for before the day's work begins he milks two
cows, feeds three "skim-milk" calves and
eight head of cattle, pumps water for them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and feeds nine pigs. He is then ready for a
hearty breakfast. One morning in March,
Herbert and his father agreed that harrowing
was more important than going to
school. So he worked five hours, harrowing
four and a half acres. Herbert did not lose
credit at school, for his teacher approved of
his morning's work, as he knew how important
it was. He was at school before the one o'clock
bell rang, had a game of ball with the
boys, and was ready for his lessons of the
afternoon. At four o'clock he hurried home,
and this is what he did before he went to
bed. First, he herded six cows for over an
hour, milked two cows, fed his skim-milk
calves, got in the wood, fed the chickens,
gathered the eggs, cleaned two barns, fed the
eight head of cattle, pumped water for them,
fed the pigs, and turned the separator ten
minutes.</p>

<p>While Herbert has had some trouble with
his arithmetic he does fine work in composition.
At the children's fair at Spokane in
October, 1913, he won fifteen dollars in cash
for the best essay on caring for a skim-milk
calf, and a pair of scales as second prize for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
an essay on how to handle a farm separator.
Here are Herbert's prizes for three years: In
1911 at the county fair at Vancouver, Washington,
he got the second award, a diploma,
on his farm exhibit; in 1912 as first prize on
farm exhibit he won a trip to the fair at
Puyallup; in 1913 at the Clarke County fair
he received ten dollars' worth of garden seeds
as second prize on farm exhibit, fifteen dollars
in cash for judging dairy cattle, while
together with his parents he won seventy-five
dollars for the best adult farm exhibit; and
at the children's state contest, 1913, he received
the first prize, fifteen dollars, for the
skim-milk calf essay.</p>

<p>A boy in one of the Portland, Oregon,
schools had trouble with his spelling, getting
a mark of only 4<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> on a scale of 10. Soon after
home credits were put into use by his teacher
he came to her and anxiously inquired if he
could help out his spelling grade with a good
home record. The teacher graciously assured
him that he could. The boy brought in each
week one of the very best home record slips,
and in some mysterious manner his spelling
improved as his hours of work increased. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
does not need his home record to help out his
spelling grade now, for last month he received
more than a passing mark, 7<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> in his weak
subject. The knowledge that there was help
at hand relieved his nervousness, and gave
him confidence.</p>

<h3>HONORING LABOR</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>She ... worketh willingly with her hands ... and eateth
not the bread of idleness. Give her of the fruit of her hands;
and let her own works praise her in the gates.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Proverbs XXXI</span>, 13, 27, 31.</p></blockquote>


<p>We are still paying a heavy price for slave
labor; for instance, the idea that it is undignified
to cook has come down through the
ages of slaveholding, and has got into some
people's blood. The school by taking into
account home tasks can make them seem
worth while and thus dignify their doing.
Many persons do not work because their
ideals are made at school, and their heroes
are those who did not win honor at labor, or,
at least, the labor of these heroes is not
emphasized.</p>

<p>In the case of Mary, the work she did at
home transformed her from a heedless girl
into a sympathetic helper. She had the idea
that too many young people have, that it
is more honorable to study algebra than to
wash dishes or to cook a meal. The minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
that she saw that they were considered equal
she no longer held back from the home work,
and when in a constructive frame of mind
she not only did the home work but did her
algebra too. There is not a normal American
boy who shrinks from a piece of work because
he thinks it is hard. On the contrary, he likes
the man's job, and seeks out the hard things
and tackles them. He avoids the things he
thinks are not worth while. So it becomes a
matter of the child's point of view whether
he likes his work or not. Too often it is the
case that the child never hears it suggested
that there is any merit in home work within
itself. He has the idea that he goes to school
to get an education, and works at home
because he has to. Many parents frankly
tell their children that they should study well
at school so they can make a living "without
working."</p>

<p>When we give home work its proper recognition,
and the child comes to understand that
there are different degrees of efficiency and
skill in doing it, the work will take on a new
color. Many are the reports that have come
in from parents in home credit districts saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
"There is nothing left for us to do in the
way of chores. The children used to seem
indifferent about the work, and did as little
as they could. Now the boys get up before we
do instead of waiting to be called, rush downstairs
to make the fires, and go at the chores,
while the girls go into the kitchen and start
breakfast."</p>

<p>While youth is the time for play, yet children
like to work too. Since we have had the
school gardens in Portland we often find the
playgrounds vacant, and the gardens near
by well filled with children at work. We often
hear that children should not have responsibilities;
yet we find that the successful men
of to-day are the ones that bore burdens early.
A number of successful business men in Portland
were recently talking together of their
boyhood days, and each one said that he had
had to assume a great deal of responsibility
before he was twelve years old.</p>

<p>The importance of "percentages," "credits,"
"grades," or "standings" in the minds
of school children, especially in the upper
grammar classrooms, is surprising to a
stranger. Even the drawing teacher is begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to give marks. "But there are the drawings,
arranged in the order of their merit, on the
screen. They can see which are the best!"
No, they want a mark. "To raise our standings,"
they say.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 386px;"><a name="weston" id="weston"></a>
<img src="images/f036.jpg" width="386" height="600" alt="weston" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WORK CREDITED AT SCHOOL, WESTON, OREGON</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of course, we all feel that "marks" in
school have but a temporary purpose; that
they are to furnish a motive to serve until a
better motive can be substituted. Home work
may be encouraged at first by the wish for
"higher standings," or a prize, or a holiday;
but many other influences are likely to come
in to keep it up.</p>

<p>This is not the place to discuss the teaching
without marks that is practiced in a few modern
schools. In most schools the system of
giving percentages is firmly established. The
honoring of achievement in the schools, by
marks or otherwise, has always been a great
power in helping the school studies move
along. But only part of the available energy
has been used. There are vast reservoirs of
power which may be put at the service of education
and which as yet have scarcely been
tapped.</p>

<p>I hope the giving of marks will never be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
main consideration with those who follow
the home credit idea, but rather the giving of
honor. Too long have pupils' out-of-school industries
been ignored at school as though they
were something to be ashamed of. Whether
we give formal credit or not, let us give honor
at school for home work.</p>

<h3>HABIT-BUILDING</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Habit second nature? Habit is ten times nature.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Duke of Wellington.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>Habits plus ideals make character. The
establishing of right habits in youth can best
be done by co&#246;peration of parents and teachers.
So far as we take habit-building as our
aim, education becomes definite and concrete.</p>

<p>At the close of his famous chapter on
"Habit," William James says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Could the young but realize how soon they will
become mere walking bundles of habit, they would
give more heed to their conduct while in the
plastic state. We are spinning our own fates, good
or evil, and never to be undone. Every smallest
stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never so little
scar.... Let no youth have any anxiety about
the upshot of his education, whatever the line of
it may be. If he keep faithfully busy each hour
of the working day, he may safely leave the final
result to itself. He can with perfect certainty
count on waking up some fine morning to find
himself one of the competent ones of his generation,
in whatever pursuit he may have singled out....
Young people should know this truth in
advance. The ignorance of it has probably engendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
more discouragement and faint-heartedness
in youths embarking on arduous careers than
all other causes put together.</p></blockquote>

<p>One habit that works for success is industry.
How easy it is for a bright boy or girl to
get through school without acquiring anything
like a habit of being industrious, even in
learning book lessons! If he is quick-minded,
as he has only to keep up with the average
child, he needs little or no work to give him
a good standing in his class. The alert child
often gains all required information by merely
listening to the other pupils. Thus we often
find failures among those bright pupils whom
we expected to find successful, because they
did not learn to dig and could do only what
came easily. Most occupations demand more
than an acquiring attitude of mind. They demand
vigorous exertion, and the seeing to it
that the thing is done. But how is there to be
any assurance that the child is forming habits
of industry if there is not co&#246;peration? The
child tells the parent that he has to prepare his
lessons and so he gets out of work at home; he
makes the plea that he is tired out by home
tasks so that he may not be given hard work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
at school. So he misses the work habit
entirely.</p>

<p>Politeness&mdash;a show of consideration for
the rights and feelings of others&mdash;is partly
a habit. Careful watching by parent and
teacher is needed to establish this consideration
as a permanent attitude of mind. It is
with much pleasure that I note that many of
the home credit cards bear the items, "Cheerfulness,"
"Kindness," "Politeness," "Keeping
temper," "Doing before told," "Care of
language," "Courtesy to parents," and the
like. And it is with very great pleasure that I
receive letters from parents and teachers saying
that the attitude of the children in these
things is becoming a habit.</p>

<p class="center">Elizabeth G&mdash;&mdash; and her mother have a small blackboard in the kitchen and here they keep a

</div>

<p>Neatness and personal care are habits that
mean much to any one. Some grown people
cannot help being neat. Others apparently
cannot be neat no matter how much they try.
Something is always wrong. It is a habit
formed when young, perhaps before the age
of twenty. In Mr. O'Reilly's list he included
sleeping with window boards in, bathing, caring
for the nails, brushing the hair, cleaning
the teeth, and going to bed by nine o'clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Personal care has been given a place on the
Portland home credit record<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which is now
used in some of the schools. Algona, a home
credit school about twenty miles from Seattle,
uses the Portland personal care section, including
bathing, brushing teeth, sleeping with
open windows, going to bed before nine
o'clock, and attending church or Sunday
school. In looking over the first home credit
slips that came in, the Algona principal found
that Nettie, a girl of thirteen, had earned just
7 per cent out of the 100 per cent given for
a perfect record in the personal division. She
had earned more than the required two hundred
and ten minutes for the week in the
regular work department at a hard round of
preparing meals, washing dishes, sweeping,
feeding the poultry, scrubbing, and so forth.
But Nettie had slept with her window closed,
had not brushed her teeth, had not taken a
bath, nor had she been in bed at the required
hour. Nettie was obviously unhappy over
the grade her card received in comparison
with the grades of her schoolmates. Before
the next report day she had in some way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
secured a toothbrush, that effective means of
promoting civilization, and had made sufficient
improvement in her personal care to
secure 65 per cent. Her grade for the third
week was 72 per cent, and for the fourth, 93
per cent. Her fourth week's report showed a
hot bath, toothbrushing twice a day, window
open every night, and that she was in bed
before nine every night but two. What her
reform will mean to the entire family it is
interesting to conjecture.</p>

<p>"Be careful about that voice, Ella,"
directed a teacher. Ella arose at her place,
a thin, stooping girl of about thirteen. She
read her passage of the lesson in a voice
scarcely audible to the visitor across the
room. A few minutes later the visitor was
looking over some home credit report slips.
"Here is a girl who did not sleep with her
windows open," she said. The teacher took
the blank, studied it a minute, then replied,
"This is the first time that child has brought
in a home credit slip. Do you recall my reminding
a little girl about her voice? That is
the girl, and this card may explain her voice
quality."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>All the pupils except two in a little Washington
town learned to sleep with their windows
open. Upon inquiry it was found that
one girl could not open her window, as it
was made for admitting light only, being
built solidly into the wall. In the case of the
other child, the parents absolutely refused to
endanger their daughter's health by letting
her breathe night air, no matter how many
faddists insisted that it was necessary!</p>

<p>Some members of a church were discussing
the problem of the spirit of incipient immorality
that they felt was prevalent among children
in the neighborhood. A home credit
teacher showed the speakers a number of the
first report cards she had received, which disclosed
the fact that very few of the pupils
under her care were ever in bed before nine
o'clock. A few months later she took occasion
to display again her pupils' home credit cards
and with pride pointed out that almost every
child was going to bed early, before nine
o'clock. "It had grown to be a habit with the
children to be up late," she said. "The immorality
talked of was not yet in actual existence
among the children, but through their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
outside evening associates was gradually
working itself in. The children had only to
be reminded in a substantial way that it was
not only desirable for them physically to retire
early, but that they were to receive recognition
in their school standing for so doing,
and they at once happily complied."</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<h3>THAT OTHER TEACHER AND THAT TEACHER'S
LABORATORY</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>We are just beginning to discover that the rural school has a
fine laboratory for practical educational purposes, in the neighborhood
environment of the school. With the development of
scientific agriculture and domestic arts in many of our modern
country homes this laboratory is constantly improving.</p>

<p class="sig"><cite>Kansas State Agricultural College Bulletin, 1914.</cite></p></blockquote>


<p>There is a general idea among teachers that
parents will not co&#246;perate with them. This, I
believe, is founded upon the assumption that
because they cannot, as a usual thing, co&#246;perate
in textbook work they will not co&#246;perate
in other things. But both parents and
teachers want the same results accomplished.
If these are to be attained it means partnership
work, the parent and that other parent,
the teacher, working together; or one might
say, the teacher, and that other teacher, the
parent, working together.</p>

<p>I have been surprised to find to what
extent parents will co&#246;perate with teachers if
given a chance. Mrs. Brown goes to the schoolhouse
on a bleak afternoon. She is greeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
warmly by the teacher, Miss Smith, and given
an arithmetic text to follow while the class recites.
The lesson is on decimal fractions. Now,
Mrs. Brown didn't have decimal fractions during
her school days, so the recitation is quite
meaningless to her. She is glad when the class
is over, and does not find time to visit school
again that term. But if she is asked to prepare
a luncheon for the picnic at the close of the
year, or asked to assist in any social function
at the schoolhouse, she spends her time for
the school, and is glad to do it.</p>

<p>In Eugene, Oregon, several years ago I
found that the women of the city were enthusiastic
in aiding the schools. Thirty-two
women gave up Monday afternoon to teaching
the girls sewing, while the boys had military
drill. At a social center meeting at
Hover, Washington, the suggestion was made
that it would be well if one of the mothers
would come to the school building occasionally
to help the girls with their sewing, as the
eighth-grade pupils would have to take an
examination in the subject in May. So many
mothers volunteered to undertake the task
that a schedule was made out whereby a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sewing period could be had every afternoon,
and no mother be on duty oftener than every
two weeks.</p>

<p>At Myrtle Creek, Oregon, domestic art
work is carried on in this way: the teacher
gives instructions in the work that is to be
done; in cooking, for instance, recipes are
given, talked over, and written down. The
girls then go home, and actually do the work,
and make a report to the teacher. They must
have the signatures of their mothers for all
the work they do. This is managed with a
home credit report card.</p>

<p>Mrs. E. H. Belknap, a progressive rural
teacher near Jefferson, Oregon, said in a
recent letter: "We learn how a cow can be
fed and cared for, so as to produce the greatest
amount of butter fat. That is well, but
we regard it of far more value for the boy to
go home, apply the knowledge learned, and
produce the butter fat. He is now worth
something to the world, and able to turn his
education into dollars and cents at any time.
The girl takes the book, and reads how to
make butter. She goes home, tends the milk,
churns, and makes the butter, learns how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
really to do the work. She has called the
attention of the entire family to the amount
and quality of her butter obtained from
proper feeding and handling of the cow by
the boy."</p>

<p>And yet it is said that nothing can be done
in the small school in domestic science because
there is no equipment. In every home
there is ideal equipment if we mean the equipment
the children are to use. If we are preparing
for life, why not use the equipment we
must use in life? Best of all, in using the home
laboratory there is an immediate purpose.
None of us can get much out of an exercise
when it is done just for an exercise. There is
the dinner to be cooked, the bed to be made,
the ironing to be done; somebody must do
it. And the dinner, the bed, and the ironing
are to be put to the test by some one who
sees real values. There is no doubt that
one of the things schools most lack is purpose.</p>

<p>It might be said that to stimulate a child
to want to do things is only half the problem.
"If children do things without expert instruction
they may do them wrong, and thus get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
faulty habit." But I think more than half of
the problem is solved when we create the
desire to do a thing. The greatest fault of
present-day education is that we constantly
try to teach a child how to do a thing without
his desiring to do it, or even knowing the
reason for doing it. On the other hand, I
once knew a country girl who had never seen
a domestic science equipment, and who lived
in a community where there was no one housekeeper
especially noted; yet with her strong
desire to be a fine housekeeper she learned
something good from each neighbor, and for
excellent results, and for economy of time
and material, her daily practice would put the
average domestic science teacher to disadvantage.
However I am not arguing that domestic
science should not be taught at school; I
certainly believe it should. But I do claim
that it is worth while, and is absolutely necessary,
first to create the desire to <em>do</em> the
things that are to be <em>taught</em>. To do things
without a purpose is like trying to eat without
an appetite.</p>

<p>A pamphlet published by the Kansas State
Agricultural College on "School Credit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Home Work: The Laboratory of the Rural
School," makes these practical points:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Could there possibly be a more favorable condition
for teaching Domestic Arts than in the rural
school from which the girl goes every evening to
a busy home where she is needed to take part in
the actual work of housekeeping? It is here that
the girl has a chance to put into actual practice
the things she has learned at school. Here the
home has the chance to realize immediately upon
the investment it is making in the education of the
girl. If sanitation, ventilation, sweeping and dusting,
care of the sick, preparation of foods, care
of milk, water supply and uses, bathing, care of
health, sewing, proper clothing, etc., are taught in
our schools, and if the laboratories are in the
immediate neighborhood, and the girls and boys
must go into them to stay overnight, they should
be used. Likewise, the vegetable gardens at the
homes should be made the experimental plots for
the school, after the best seeds have been selected,
best methods of preparing, fertilizing, and planting
the soil, best-known methods of cultivation and
maturing the crops, have been taught. The actual
experimental work should be carried out in the
home gardens by the boys and girls. Proper
records can be kept, and the boys and girls will be
anxious to get back into school, after the out-of-doors
summer experiments, to compare reports,
and renew another phase of their educational
work.</p>

<p>In agriculture the fields, stock, buildings, etc.,
about the schoolhouse should be studied and used.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
These are the real agricultural laboratory. The
real problems of actual farming are present, and
the methods of work and the ways of handling the
fields and the stock are the available resources of
the school as a part of its actual laboratory. In
this connection study the dairy cows, the feeding
of cattle, hogs, and horses, types and breeds of
farm horses, cattle, hogs, and sheep. In every
community there are many opportunities for
type studies&mdash;such as fields of alfalfa or wheat
or corn; a dairy herd; valuable and well-bred
horses; beef cattle; hogs or sheep; a silo, or types
of farm machinery, and farm buildings.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is natural for a child to want to assume
home responsibilities, but there are many
things that interfere unless a special effort is
made. The school itself has been a great
offender in weaning children from their homes
and from natural living. This, of course, is
not strange when we consider that the school
started out to make lawyers and ministers,
and not home-makers. Yet one of the great
needs of the time is to make people home-loving,
and to have those wholesome habits
that come from sharing home responsibilities.
Anything is worth while that will make the
child once taste the joy of doing a useful thing
well.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>STELLA AND SADIE</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">Through ignorance ye did it.&mdash;Acts <small>III</small>, 17.</p></blockquote>


<p>"Let the school go on just as it has. What
business is it of the school to meddle with the
home work? Of course most children do certain
chores at home, but why confuse the work of
the home with the work of the school?"</p>

<p>Have you heard this speech? I have heard
it several times. Does justice demand that we
know what pupils do outside of school? Must
the teacher know home conditions in order
to teach efficiently? I have in mind a true
story that answers these questions and shows
the injustice of teaching children when one
knows little or nothing of their home life. I
am sure most teachers have had similar experiences.</p>

<p>In a certain schoolroom in a certain town I
noticed one day two girls in the same class
sitting near each other. The contrast between
them was so great that I became interested in
them, and found out something of their history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and circumstances. Stella, the younger
one, eleven years old, was a perfect picture
of rosy health. Her brown hair was beautiful
and most becomingly arranged. Many
women would have been delighted to wear
such furs as she put on at the noon recess.
Well dressed and well nourished, she had the
look of one much loved at school and at home,
one to whom life was all happiness.</p>

<p>Stella is the only child of wealthy and
doting parents. If we should follow her home
we should find a well-kept modern house, and
we should see that the mother who greets her
at the door is just such a mother as we should
expect for such a girl. While the evening meal
is being prepared, her mother sits beside her
at the piano, and helps with her practice, and
when the father comes in, the three sing
together until dinner is announced. After
dinner her mother helps her with her Least
Common Multiple and Greatest Common
Divisor. They all discuss her composition
and then her mother asks her to read aloud,
and reads to her. Promptly at nine o'clock
she goes to bed in just the kind of room a
little girl loves. The windows are opened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the proper width, the heat is turned off, she
is kissed good-night, and is told, "Mother
loves you, and Father will come in and kiss
you when he comes home."</p>

<p>In the morning at seven o'clock she is called
by a very gentle voice, and told it is time for
Mother's angel to leave her dreams. Her
mother helps her dress, and brushes and
braids her hair. "What will Father's sweetheart
have for breakfast this morning?" She
will have grape-fruit and a poached egg on
toast. After some fitting by the seamstress
for a new dress to be added to her already full
wardrobe, she is thoroughly inspected and is
ready for school. She is given some flowers
for the teacher, and is accompanied part way
by her mother. She is early at school, her
teacher kisses her, pats her cheeks, and
Stella is ready for the lessons, the lessons her
mother helped her with the evening before.
There she is, happy, radiant!</p>

<p>Now let us go home with the other girl.
Sadie is thirteen, but she looks much older
notwithstanding her frail little figure. Did I
say home? Be the judge. A few years ago her
father and her aunt ran away together, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the mother with Sadie and two younger
children. The broken-spirited mother died
after the desertion, and the father and aunt
returned, were married, and took possession
of the house and the three children. They
now have a baby a year old. The family live
in a tumbledown house at the edge of the city.
On entering the house Sadie receives no greeting
from her stepmother-aunt, who is sitting
by a dirty window reading. The child
knows what work there is to do, and goes at
it sullenly. After the meal, at which she
scarcely has time to sit down, she has to do
up the work, and then is sent on an errand.
When she returns it is nine o'clock and she is
hardly able to keep her eyes open. The Least
Common Multiple and the Greatest Common
Divisor are like Greek to her. After she has
tried to study a few minutes, her stepmother
disturbs her by throwing her brother's stockings
into her lap to be mended. When this
task is completed, and the potatoes are peeled
for breakfast, she goes upstairs. She tenderly
draws the covers about her sleeping brother
and creeps into bed beside her little sister.
Though she is very weary, her starved soul is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
comforted as she cuddles and kisses her sister
before she drops to sleep.</p>

<p>In the night she awakens, and thinking
Harry is again uncovered she slips over to his
bed, like a little mother, and again adjusts
the bedclothes. The baby awakens at five
o'clock, and Sadie is called and told to make
a fire and warm the milk. She then gets
breakfast, does the kitchen work, spreads up
the beds, sews a button on her brother's coat,
braids her sister's hair, and is late at school.</p>

<p>She came in a few minutes late the morning
I visited her room. The class was trying to
make a record for punctuality, and had tied
another room for first place until this morning
when Sadie's lateness set them behind. The
teacher was provoked and reproved Sadie.
The pupils showed their scorn in many ways
and said she was the cause of all but three of
the tardy marks of the term. The teacher
knew that the principal would ask her why
she did not improve her tardy record. The
pupils knew that their chances for a half-holiday
were spoiled as long as "that Sadie
Johnson" was in the room.</p>

<p>This morning especially the teacher wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to make a good showing because she wanted
a place in a larger city and hoped that I would
recommend her. Arithmetic was the first
thing on the program. The principal had
boasted of the work of his school in arithmetic.
The work went beautifully, for Stella
led off with a perfect recitation. The pride of
the whole class was evident, the teacher was
hopeful. But wanting to see the work of all
the pupils, I asked several questions, and at
last called upon Sadie. She didn't know, she
stood abashed, and showed absolute lack of
understanding of the subject. The principal
was provoked. The teacher was plainly humiliated,
and said in a tone that was low,
but loud enough for Sadie and several of the
children to hear, "The girl is not only lazy,
but feeble-minded."</p>

<p>So it was the whole term. Sadie was tortured
each school day, condemned by the
most powerful court in the world, her companions,
led by her teacher. And the reason
was that the teacher was teaching only the
six-hour-a-day girl. One does not have to go
to Turkey to see examples of injustice and
cruelty. But let us not be too critical of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
teacher. She is tender-hearted and sympathetic.
She weeps over the heroines in books,
and has latent longings to be of service in the
world. In this case she did not know the conditions
that made Sadie stupid. If she had
been interested in the children's out-of-school
work, and had had them tell her about it, she
would have known that the frail little unkempt
girl was compelled to do a woman's
work at home besides trying to get her lessons.
Then she would have seen the tragedy in the
child's appealing glance and have understood
her. Some people go through life without
finding an opportunity to do justice, such as
was this teacher's. In ministering to the soul-hunger
of this little girl she might have given
the service that she had dreamed of giving.
It would have been the kind of service that is
its own reward.</p>

<h3>A STORY AND LETTERS FROM TEACHERS</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Story From Nebraska, by Mrs. Sarah J.
Hoagland</span></p>


<p>One spring found me in Nebraska teaching
a school of German and Bohemian children,
only two of whom spoke English. I boarded
with a German family who lived about a mile
from the school. In our walks to and from
school I taught the children English. They
and their father were born in Nebraska, but
at first none of them could speak English so
that I could understand it, although I understood
some of their German.</p>

<p>The oldest boy&mdash;ten years old&mdash;lanky,
with awkward gait, and fair, straight-standing
hair, had a dogged, sullen look. It was a
"home" look, especially when the father was
around, but it left when he was trying to tell
about birds or other interesting things. His
telling me that he intended to work in town as
soon as possible gave me a peep into his heart
as regarded home. It was not a happy home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The father often drank, and at such times he
was harsh and cruel. The mother was meek
and subdued. She never had known how to do
good housekeeping. She told me that when a
girl in Germany, being large and strong, she
had had to work in the fields instead of learning
housework.</p>

<p>The farm was run down; the house was
bare and unhomelike. The father's voice was
often raised in upbraiding in "Low Dutch."
He often had the children rounded up for
punishment for starting fires or other mischief.
The seven-year-old boy was more efficient,
either in the home or out, than the ten-year-old
boy. I noticed that he had a better head
and intelligence. His efficiency was due to
this, not to any better training.</p>

<p>The mother often cried over the brutality
of the father to the oldest boy. I determined
to study the situation, and I found a remedy.
I learned that the father could do practically
nothing in arithmetic. He had attended
school for his confirmation&mdash;a little reading
in German being the only apparent result.
So I taught the boy arithmetic, and after I
had worked with him two hours every night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
for several months, he could do addition better
than his father. It was wonderful to see
the pride and dawning respect on the father's
face as the boy figured correctly the weight of
many wagon-loads of grain lately taken to the
elevator. I knew then that the unreasonable
whipping would tend to stop. I seldom
see a father unreasonable with a boy he can
be proud of at school. So the sky was clear
for a time.</p>

<p>But when the press of spring work came on
and the father found he could not afford to
employ help, he grew moody and was even
savage again. He drank, and at times I was
afraid of him myself. But I liked the mother.
I knew she needed the board money for the
children, and I wanted to see the case of the
boy to a finish. So I stayed on. The lovely
outdoor surroundings, too, made me want to
stay. The orchard was beautiful&mdash;the finest
in the neighborhood. The birds sang in a
large maple at my window. This was a treat
to a flat-dweller. Since then I have ever loved
the country.</p>

<p>I often asked the mother what the father
was saying to the oldest boy. I knew as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
as the boy was concerned I could help the
matter by influencing him. She said that the
father was complaining that the boy was
worthless as a worker. For one thing, he had
milked and left the milk in the barnyard in
order to play. The complaints kept pouring
in on the patient mother. The father was
working early and late to get abreast of the
season's work. He forgot what sleep was, and
grew thin and haggard and more and more
savage.</p>

<p>I felt that only some distinct advance would
have effect on either father or boy. I asked
if the boy could drive a horse. He couldn't.
He could not work a single piece of the machinery
on the farm. That is most unusual
in Nebraska, for the light soil can be worked
by machinery which a boy can learn to run if
he can also guide horses. The father would
not teach the boy&mdash;had no patience with
him. So the mother and I made our plans.
She approached the father with the question
of getting a team and machine for the boy.
It happened to be a cornstalk cutter that
was needed. The father consented, provided
the mother would teach the boy! She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
done such work, though she was not strong
enough to do it this year.</p>

<p>But I saw her that Saturday toiling in the
hot sun, walking up and down the rows,
touching up the horses. The boy proved most
apt. I soon saw him going up and down alone,
still under his mother's eye, however. The
boy seemed to grow two years in importance,
self-reliance, and ambition in that day's
work! This training was kept up out of school
hours for some time, and the boy learned to
work other machinery, the last thing a corn-planter.</p>

<p>As soon as the father realized what the
boy was doing, he was a transformed man.
The knowledge that he had a helper seemed
to clear the atmosphere. Before this the boy
had always kept out of the father's way. Now
he forsook the mother! It was "Papa and
me" from that time in his talk. This new
attitude made it all the easier for the wife,
for it was a relief from what had been her
greatest trouble&mdash;having to stand between
the two.</p>

<p>The father's pride and confidence in his son
kept on growing. In many ways he was just a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
good-natured big giant, but he turned like a
bear on anything that annoyed him.</p>

<p>I remember the first day the boy stayed
out of school to work, how it seemed to me a
deciding day in his life. I rarely like to see
a child stay out of school, but that day I
thought the industrial training much more
important than anything I could teach the
boy in those hours of school. He came regularly
after the rush of work was over.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A School in Montana:
Mrs. Hoagland's First Letter To the Author</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Last September I heard your lecture on credit
being given in school for home work. I have tried
it lately after working the children up to grade.
I started by getting acquainted with the homes,
finding out what the children did and what they
could do further. I made inquiries as to whether
the children, in their play, left things around for
the mother to pick up and so on. The spirit the
work is done in counts, too, in credit given. The
work must be done pleasantly and cheerfully; the
mother must be asked for work; she is not to be
hunting the child up to get him to do the work.</p>

<p>One little girl of eleven made bread from beginning
to end, never having tried it entirely before.
She has an overworked mother. In another home
I found the two older children took charge of a
teething baby while the mother, an ex-teacher and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
rather delicate, did the housework. The little
girl, six years old, could do dishes and otherwise
help the mother. In another home the boy has
grown to be the pride of his father's heart by
forcing the father back into the chair, when he
was weary, and doing the chores himself.</p>

<p>One boy, his father told me two weeks ago, was
growing as dependable as his brother five years
older, and helped bring the cows, herd cattle from
one field to another before and after school and
on non-school days. There was much other work,
light in itself, but wonderfully helpful to his
father, that was taken charge of cheerfully.</p>

<p>One child's father had a hired man. The boy
did but little. He is eight years old and large.
While visiting there, I saw his father bringing in
coal. I told the boy he would find it necessary
to look up work if he cared for credit. His mother
visited school shortly after this; I was telling her
of the idea and she said she now understood why
Bennie had started to clear the table several times,
and so on. We had a very happy laugh over it.
The boy hunts the eggs, gets in the wood and coal,
makes the mash for the chickens, and helps wash
the dishes.</p>

<p>Another child, aged thirteen, has to do much
outside work, so she feels good over getting credit
for it. It is a kind of pay that makes her days
pleasanter. I believe each child richly deserves
the credit I have given. The results have been
to make the tie between the parents and myself
stronger, and I am asked to come back next year.
I have seen a gladder, prouder light in the parents'
eyes concerning their children. It has helped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
make our school in some respects without a
superior in the county, according to the county
superintendent's own word. A member of the
board says the children never have made such
progress since the school was built, and all say
these children never have made as much progress
before. They are learning, as far as I can teach
them, the honor of labor and the beauty of being
useful, willing, and dependable. I have had a
hard battle to wage here for good, thorough work
and application, but the right has won.</p>

<p>I enclose a report that shows the kinds of work
the children are in the habit of doing.</p>

<p>I am the teacher who spoke to you about the
new oats being brought into the dryland country.
It is now being introduced into another part of
Montana where my homestead is. You will perhaps
remember me.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap">A Letter from Mrs. E. H. Belknap, Marion
County, Oregon</span></p>

<p>I believe intensely in an education that teaches
the boy or girl not only how the book says to do a
thing, but how, by actual experience and practice,
that thing is best worked out and brought to
perfection....</p>

<p>In this district we have used home credits for
two years. First, in order to make this a success,
the teacher must believe in it, and must be a
worker. We have given credits for everything
from plowing to washing the baby for breakfast.
As a result we have the little girls dressing their
own hair for school, the older ones cooking breakfast,
washing, ironing, etc. The boys plow, milk,
clean stables, cut wood, feed horses, do all kinds
of work for credits; <em>doing it, they have become interested
in it, and before they knew it a habit has been
formed of doing things at the right time in the right
way</em>. It is truly wonderful what these children do.
Some of them walk three or four miles, and still
earn hundreds of credits in a week. Some of my
girls milk as many as eight cows twice a day, and
the boys plow and harrow acres of ground. They
do the work gladly, too.</p>

<p>Monday mornings we give out blanks to be
filled out, signed by parents, and returned the
following Monday morning. We always go over
the cards carefully. <em>I call the names aloud, and the
pupils report quickly. If extra work has been accomplished
I always try to praise the effort. It is a happy
hour when the reports are rendered.</em></p>

<p>At first we agreed that when any pupil earned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
six hundred or more credits he should be entitled
to a holiday. Thousands of credits have been
earned, but no one has asked for the holiday!
Frequently, when the pupil has been ill, or forced
to miss a day, he has asked that the credits be
applied to blot out the absent marks, and this has
always been granted.</p>

<h2>PART TWO</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="center">ILLUSTRATIVE HOME CREDIT PLANS</p>


<p>Upon the demonstration of the success of
the home credit plan in the Spring Valley
School I began to hear of other Oregon
schools that had taken it up and were carrying
it on successfully. During the school
year 1913-14, three hundred and twenty-five
teachers in Oregon and in Washington were
giving school credit for home work, while the
scheme had been adopted by some schools in
other States.</p>

<p>For the aid of those who may contemplate
its use, the outlines of several plans that have
been instituted are printed here, together
with excerpts of letters we have received, and
cards made out by pupils. These reports
come from teachers who have used the scheme
successfully in various forms. The daily report
plans are given first, and the letters are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
arranged according to the frequency of the
report from the home to the school.</p>

<p>It will be noted that some teachers use a
card that is supposed to last for a whole year,
being returned to the teacher monthly as
school cards are often returned to the parent
monthly; others have cards that are marked
daily, and last for only a week. Some teachers
use a contest plan of awards like Mr.
O'Reilly's; others add credits to the average
obtained in school subjects; and others do
both. The first user of the parent-signed
report, Mr. O'Reilly, used no cards, but had
the children write little notes with lists of
their labors every day for their parents to
sign. A bulletin from the Kansas Agricultural
College suggests that pupils should furnish
the reports themselves over their own
signatures.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The only record of failure we
have was in a school where monthly report
cards were used, and no definite scheme
of duties was laid down,&mdash;merely so many
minutes of unspecified labor. I find that
children are more interested when their performance
of particular duties is recorded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>I should never advise the wholesale adoption
of any one plan, but I would suggest that
superintendents and teachers adapt plans to
the needs of their districts. Several schools
have been reported where an enthusiastic
principal has put the plan into operation
throughout his school, regardless of the ideas
of his teachers. I find that teachers never feel
inspiration in a work that they do not want
to undertake. Therefore, it would be my suggestion
that under no circumstances should a
teacher be asked to use home credits unless
she herself desires it.</p>


<p class="center">DAILY REPORTS</p>

<p>The following is the method which Mr.
A. I. O'Reilly originated at the Spring Valley
School, in 1911-12:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center"><em>Rules of the Contest</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. No pupil is obliged to enter the contest.</p>

<p>2. Any pupil entering is free to quit at any time,
but if any one quits without good cause, all
credits he or she may have earned will be
forfeited.</p>

<p>3. Parent or guardian must send an itemized
list (with signature affixed) to the teacher each
morning. This list must contain a record of the
work each child has done daily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Each day the teacher will issue a credit
voucher to the pupil. This voucher will state
the total number of minutes due the pupil
each day for home work.</p>

<p>5. At the close of the contest pupils will return
vouchers to the teacher, the six pupils who
have earned the greatest amount of time, per
the vouchers, receiving awards.</p>

<p>6. Contest closes when term of school closes.</p>

<p>7. Once each month the names of the six pupils
who are in the lead will be published in the
county papers.</p>

<p>8. Ten per cent credit will be added to final
examination results of all pupils (except eighth
graders) who enter and continue in the contest.</p>

<p>9. When a pupil has credits to the amount of one
day earned, by surrender of the credits, and
by proper application to the teacher, he or she
may be granted a holiday, provided that not
more than one holiday may be granted to a
pupil each month.</p>

<p>10. Forfeitures&mdash;dropping out of contest without
cause, all credits due; unexcused absence, all
credits due; unexcused tardiness, 25 per cent
of all credits due; less than 90 per cent in
deportment for one month, 10 per cent of all
credits due.</p>

<p>11. Awards&mdash;the three having the highest credits,
$3 each; the three having second highest,
$2 each. Awards to be placed in a savings

<p>While it is sometimes more convenient to
have printed record slips, it is not necessary.
Mr. O'Reilly carried on the grading by having
each child write out his home credit work on
ordinary tablet paper. The great majority
of home credit schools have used the plan in
1914 without any printing whatever. It
affords the children practice in written expression.</p>

<p>I give here two sample slips brought in by
Mr. O'Reilly's pupils in the first home credit
contest in the United States.</p>

<p>Superintendent A. R. Mack, of Holton,
Kansas, has issued the following plan for
daily reports and the issue of credit vouchers
monthly, in bulletin form. Notice that the
pupil who is paid in money, or in any other
way, for home work receives no credit. This
card gives a very desirable emphasis to manners
and personal care:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><br /><em>Rules</em></p>

<p class="hanging2">1. No pupil is obliged to enter contest.</p>

<p class="hanging2">2. Any pupil entering is free to quit at any time,
but if any one quits without good cause, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
credits he or she may have earned will be
forfeited.</p>

<p class="hanging2">3. Parent or guardian must send daily to the
teacher an itemized list with signature
attached; this list must contain the record of
the work each child has done daily.</p>

<p class="hanging2">4. At the end of each week the teacher may read
the number of credits due the pupil for that
week. At the end of each month the teacher
shall issue a credit voucher to the pupil giving
the total number of credits due to the pupil
up to date, for home work.</p>

<p class="hanging2">5. The pupil in each grade making the highest
number of credits each month will receive an
added credit of 10 per cent of all credits due.</p>

<p class="hanging2">6. The school shall be divided into two divisions.
The boy and the girl in each division
in each building receiving the highest number
of credits at the end of each half-year
shall be awarded a suitable medal.</p>

<p class="hanging2">7. The boy and the girl in each division in each
building receiving the second highest number
of credits shall at their own option be
awarded a medal or an additional 10 per cent
of credits already due.</p>

<p class="hanging2">8. Ten per cent credit will be added to final
examination results of all pupils who enter
this contest before November 1, and continue
in it until the end of the year. Those entering
school after November 1 must enter contest
before January 1, in order to receive examination
credit.</p>

<p class="hanging2">9. Pupils entering the contest before November 1
or January 1 will be given credit not only on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
final examination grades, but on monthly
examination grades.</p>

<p class="hanging2">10. In case a pupil enters the contest after November 1
or January 1, credits for home work will
apply on monthly examination grades only.</p>

<p>The following schedule has been adopted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grades of 95 to 100, additional credit of
half the amount between the grade and 100.</p>

<p>Grades of 90 to 95, a credit of 3 is given.</p>

<p>Grades of 85 to 90, a credit of 2 is given.</p>

<p>Grades of 80 to 85, a credit of 1 is given.</p>

<p>Below 80, no credit.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hanging2">11. Any pupil in the first three grades earning 600
credits during a given month may have a
quarter holiday. Pupils in the fourth grade
must make 700 credits; pupils in the fifth
grade must make 800 credits; pupils in the
sixth grade must make 900 credits; pupils in
the seventh and eighth grades must make
1000 credits for a quarter holiday.</p>

<p>All holidays are at the discretion of the
teacher; <em>provided</em>, that the pupil may not have
more than one quarter holiday in any 20 days,
and <em>provided</em>, that the teacher thinks that it
will not interfere with school work.</p>

<p>In case deportment is below 90 per cent,
the holiday will be refused.</p>

<p class="hanging2">12. Forfeitures&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="hanging2">(<em>a</em>) Dropping out of contest without cause
forfeits all credits due.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<em>b</em>) Unexcused absence forfeits all credits
due.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<em>c</em>) Tardiness forfeits 25 per cent of all credits
due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging2">(<em>d</em>) Less than 90 per cent in deportment in
one month forfeits 10 per cent of all credits
due.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<em>e</em>) Loss of temper forfeits 5 credits.</p>

<p class="hanging2">(<em>f</em>) Bad table manners forfeit 5 credits.</p>

<p class="hanging2">13. Once each month the names of the six pupils
who are in the lead will be published in the
Holton papers.</p>

<p class="hanging2">14. A pupil who receives compensation for work
done, whether he is paid in money or in any
other way, shall receive no school credit for
such work.</p>

<p class="center"><em>General Rule</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>For unlisted work credit will be given. One credit
will be given for every two minutes' work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. N. V. Rowe, the teacher at St. John,
Whitman County, Washington, describes a
novel plan:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At first I used a credit card arranged after the
order of a meal ticket. The plan was to have the
card hold credits enough for one school day of 360
minutes, arranged by 5's, 10's, 15's, 20's, 25's, and
30's. The idea is all right were it amplified so as
to include a school week. The teacher has a punch,
and punches or cancels credits as presented. I
found this took too many cards for each pupil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Some brought in as high as 360 minutes in credits
each day, and even more than that in some cases.
At present I am using a plan similar to a grocer's
manifolding or duplicating book where totals are
forwarded each day. This saves time and in some
ways is better than the ticket plan.</p>

<p>The results have certainly justified the effort
here. (1) It lessens tardiness; (2) it enlists the
attention of parents quicker than anything else;
(3) it stimulates to better work in school; (4) it
creates a wholesome rivalry. I have heard the
following objections to it: It requires too much
time of a teacher already very busy; and pupils
get a holiday when they ought to be at their
studies. These objections are weak. The plan
certainly has a sound pedagogic principle for its
foundation.</p>

<p>The children get but one holiday a month. In
case a pupil is ill or necessarily absent for a day,
it is very convenient to allow that as a holiday.
This helps the attendance record wonderfully,
and is perfectly legitimate, so far as I can see. We
have been doing that way all the present year.
Bear in mind, we allow such as a holiday only
when one has not been allowed already for that
particular month. In the register I mark the initial
"H" wherever a holiday is granted, and in this
way I keep tab.</p></blockquote>

<p>At Burnt Ridge, near Alpha, Washington,
in Mrs. Venona E. Toman's school, a postal-card
photograph is given as a little reward
of merit for each 1000 credits earned. Five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
credits are taken off for coming to school
with neck and ears not clean. One hundred
and twenty credits are given to the child who
washes, starches, and irons her school clothes
for the week. Practicing music and studying
lessons get ten credits for half an hour; but
hard work, like sawing wood and making a
garden, gets one credit for each two minutes.</p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from a letter
from the Burnt Ridge teacher:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have the children keep their own records, telling
them that I want them to learn to do their own
business. Then their mothers look over and sign
their reports. Without one exception the parents
are pleased with the plan. The mothers tell me
that the children hurry to get all done they possibly
can before school time, as they want their
credits to increase. One mother said there was
more trouble now between her two girls because
neither one <em>wanted help</em> than there was before
<em>when they wanted help</em>. I require that the work be
done cheerfully. One mother said she believed her
daughters sang about their work many times when
they did not feel a bit like it. I notice myself, and
others tell me that it is making a difference in the
homes. I think this one of the best features that
has been added to the school work. It teaches
independence, thoughtfulness, and thrift.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">MORNING AND EVENING RECORD, WEEKLY
REPORT</p>

<p>Marion County, Oregon, uses a card issued
by Superintendent W. M. Smith, which provides
for a record of daily morning and evening
home tasks, and a weekly report.</p>

<p>This county forms an object lesson in the
correct presentation of a subject of this kind.
Superintendent Smith first picked out a
teacher that he knew had initiative and was
able to carry her people with her. He explained
the matter to her in detail and kept in
close touch with her work. Her success was so
pronounced that he thought that it was not
necessary to make much effort to extend the
plan into the surrounding districts; he knew
it would spread of itself. And it did; like a
prairie fire, he found it leaping over districts
and catching in others, until now it is widely
used in the county. The card is the result of
much experience and a few conferences with
some of Mr. Smith's best people.</p>

<p>Notice that honesty of record is emphasized;
also observe the details of dairy work
and the care of horses:&mdash;</p>

<p>Oscar. L. Dunlap, principal of the school at
Salem Heights, Marion County, gives the
following explanation of the way home credits
were recognized in his school the first year:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The first month we gave cash prizes; then this
was abandoned and we allowed 20 per cent to be
added to each of any two subjects, and 10 per cent
to any one subject in the monthly tests. We give
twelve questions (answer any ten) and those having
20 per cent allowance need answer only eight
questions, and so on. In my room the pupils work
harder to earn the 20 per cent allowance than they
did to earn the cash prizes; for in this way every
one receives a prize. Some think this is a wrong
way to give rewards. I was myself in doubt at
first; but my pupils have actually worked harder
during the past two months than during the six
months before we adopted this plan.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">DAILY RECORDS, WEEKLY REPORTS</p>

<p>In Spokane County, Washington, one hundred
and thirteen teachers have used home
credits during the school year of 1913-14.
Superintendent E. G. McFarland became
interested in the work that one of his rural
teachers started on home credits at the opening
of the schools in the fall of 1913. Mr. McFarland
obtained what information he
could on the subject, and then worked out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
plan. This made provision for a daily record
for five days, and a weekly report. At his
institute he presented the project to his
teachers, and in January some eighty-one
began the work. Others soon followed.</p>

<p class="center">The members are receiving school credits for club work carried out regularly. The president is "talking potatoes"
to the members of the club</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Spokane Chamber of Commerce sent
out a story of Spokane County's home credits
to eight hundred and fifty of its correspondents
in the United States and Canada. For a
while the superintendent's office was flooded
with letters of inquiry relative to the plan.
This shows the great interest taken everywhere
in any movement calculated to better
the child's school and home relationship.</p>

<p>At a parent-teachers' meeting in Spokane
a committee was appointed to assist the
principal of one of the schools in keeping the
children off the streets. At that time it was
arranged that credit at school should be given
to all children off the streets after six o'clock,
and to those who did not go to evening
parties.</p>

<p>Below is the Spokane County plan.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Bulletin for Teachers: Home Credits</em></p>

<p>The following are the rules and reward offered
for home work. This work is to be done during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
school week. No one is compelled to enter this
contest and the pupil may drop out at any time.</p>

<p>All work must be voluntary on the part of the
pupil. Parents are requested not to sign papers
for pupils if the work is not voluntarily and cheerfully
done.</p>

<p>The rewards for this work are:&mdash;</p>

<p>One half-holiday each month to the child who
has earned one hundred or more home credits, and
has not been absent or tardy for the month; also</p>

<p>5 per cent will be added to his final examination.
The pupil who earns one hundred or more credits
each month but fails in perfect attendance will
have the 5 per cent added to his final examination.</p>

<p>In addition, the board of directors may offer a
prize to the pupil in each grade who shall have the
greatest amount of home credits, and shall be
neither absent nor tardy during the term, or from
the adoption of these rules.</p>

The following statement is made by Superintendent
McFarland as to the effect home
credits had on attendance in 1913-14:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We attribute the increase in our attendance this
year in the schools of Spokane County, outside the
city of Spokane, largely to the Home Credit System
and our certificates for perfect attendance.
While the enrollment was 108 less than last year,
yet our attendance was 16,712 days more. At the
present rate of 16 cents per day, the pupils earned
for the county, from the State appropriation, nearly
$2700 more than last year. With the same enrollment
as last year the increase of apportionment
would have reached approximately $6000.</p></blockquote>

<p>The credit slip for the school week provides
for a daily record of "chores or work done"
from Monday to Friday inclusive. It does
not contain a stated list of duties; the blanks
are to be filled in by the child. The list of
home credits is furnished each district, but
the teacher uses her judgment in allowing
credit for any chore peculiar to her locality.
On page 92 is given one of these blanks with
the work itemized. Note the evidence of cooperation
between Jessie and her mother. On
the mornings when Jessie gets the breakfast
her mother dresses the baby, and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>I am nine years old, and in the fourth grade. I
think I will pass into the fifth grade. I like to go
to school. My teacher is Miss Grier. I like her.
We get Home Credits in our school.</p>

<p>I haven't any pets, but I have a little sister and
a little brother. They are twins, and were born
on my birthday, June 11. Their names are Ruth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and Millard. They are awfully sweet and good,
and I like them a good deal better than pets. I get
credit at school for taking care of them.</p>

<p>Superintendent McFarland has received
many letters of appreciation from teachers
and parents in his county. One teacher
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The system helps, in bringing the school and
home closer together by letting the parents see that
we count the practical duties of the house and
of the farm of actual value in the training of the
child.</p>

<p>One father is encouraging his three boys to earn
more than the required home credits by paying
them a small sum of money for each additional
five credits.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The teachers have noted many cases of much
improved personal cleanliness, which in itself has
been a welcome reward. Then, you know, improved
morals go hand in hand with clean bodies.
We are taking into account the fact that cleanliness
on the part of one child usually forces
another to clean up on account of the inevitable
contrast.</p></blockquote>

<p>A parent writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The home credit system is to my mind one of
the most practical features that has been introduced
into the public-school curriculum for some
time. It teaches the children self-reliance, and
encourages them to take the initiative when heretofore
they have been indifferent or careless. Its
practical help to the parents is inestimable, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
children in pursuit of "credits" take innumerable
burdens from the parents' shoulders.</p></blockquote>

<p>This from another parent:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Regarding the home credit system of the public
school, my sentiment as the parent of two boys
attending school is that it is working fine. It makes
my boys ambitious to earn as many credits as
possible, and this system as laid out leads them to
take interest in the practical duties of their home,
thereby saving parents many a step, and training
the boys for useful work. The home credit system
also stimulates punctuality in attending school as
well as personal neatness, and regular habits in
going to bed at the right time. <em>It seems to me that
this credit system to a great extent completes the purpose
of the public school.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>One teacher in Spokane County has solved
the problem of the rural janitor with home
credits. Like thousands of other girls teaching
in country schools, she had difficulty in
keeping the schoolhouse clean. Beginning in
January she offered school credit for outside
work, and she included in her list the care of
the schoolhouse. She reports that the room
is kept perfectly now. The floors are swept,
the woodwork dusted, the blackboards and
erasers cleaned, water and wood supplied.
This same teacher, Miss Lizzie K. Merritt,
says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is not pleasant to work without appreciation.
We all know that we make a short job of the unappreciated
piece of work. We cannot expect a child
to stay with a thing as long as an older person
unless he sees a definite reward. I have found that
home credits teach observation, accuracy, and
punctuality.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following is an excerpt from a circular
sent out by Mr. Harry F. Heath, principal of
the school at Eveline, Lewis County, Washington,
at the beginning of a home credit
contest, stating his plan. This makes provision
for a daily record for six days, a weekly
report, and a voucher:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Eveline Public School</em></p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Eveline, Wash.</span>, January 5, 1914.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Patron</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the rush of classes, we of the
school forget about the home life of the scholar.
And many times you of the home know but little
of what is going on at school. In order to connect
more closely for the pupil the influences of both
home and school, I am planning this contest in
home work for the next four months.</p>

<p>In order that the contest may be successful, we
ask the sympathy and aid of each parent. The
parent is the judge of the amount of work done
by the pupil, and upon the parent we depend for
the accuracy of the reports. Have the pupil prepare
his or her own list of duties performed, ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
for your signature, and make it your duty to see
that the lists are accurate at all times, neither
more nor less than the actual amount performed.
All lists should be dated, and none will be accepted
unless signed by you.</p>

<p>The prizes will not be expensive, and will be
given only as tokens of award. The real awards
will be realized during the course of the contest
as set forth by the rules.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows the list of credits and the
rules.</p>

<p>A letter from Mr. Heath dated April 21,
1914, tells the way in which he carried on the
work this year. Mr. Heath says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In answer to your request for information about
our home credits contest, I am sending some of the
circulars which I used at the beginning, and also
some vouchers made by the pupils which I use to
give out weekly credits. I am also sending some
sample slips of credits brought in by some of the
pupils. These slips show credits for an entire
week, which has proved to be the most satisfactory
way to have the slips kept. A notebook kept by
me of the weekly and monthly totals, as well as
the holidays granted and forfeitures assessed, is
all of the record that our system has required.</p>

<p>Two progressive business men of Chehalis are
furnishing inexpensive prizes in the form of books
to go to the seven leaders in the contest at its close.
Four of the prizes will probably go to boys, but
by the rules at least three are to go to girls. I find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in this community that the boys have much more
opportunity to earn credits than the girls. Hence
the rule.</p>

<p>The contest has run for four months and is
closing this week. It has been very well received
in the community, a number of suggestions having
come in from parents in the way of additional
credits. One was a request that credits be given
for daily reading of the Bible, and the change was
made. In my room, which is the highest in our
two-room school, practically all of the scholars
started, and of the thirty-four at that time in the
contest about twenty-five are still enrolled, and
the percentage would be larger if some of the
beginners had not moved away.</p>

<p>The contest was tried for a while in the lower
grades but was not successful there. We limited
the points that might be added to the general
average to six in any one month, and most of the
live contestants got their six every month.</p>

<p>I got my ideas of the contest directly from Mr.
Alderman's article, which I found in some paper.
It has been on the whole very successful, and
worth while. When I try this sort of work again,
it will be on the plan of regular credits, not in
contest form. I believe the Spokane County plan
as used this spring is one that would prove very
satisfactory.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Eveline "voucher" plan gives the
pupil something to watch for. The first
paragraph of Mr. Heath's letter explains the
use of these vouchers. Below are sample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
vouchers, and copies of slips made out by
the pupils. The pupils rule the columns, and
write out their own records, according to a
published list which shows the value in minutes
of each task. This work is good practice
for the pupil in ruling lines and making neat
cards, and it saves the cost of printing cards.</p>

<p>The vouchers, which are taken home, enable
each pupil to have at home, as well as at
school, a record of the total amount of his
work.</p>

<p>The scheme of giving credit at school for work
done at home by the pupils can be made successful
only through your co&#246;peration, and faithful report
of the work done.</p>

<p>Every Friday afternoon a Home Work Record
Slip will be given each pupil. Beginning with
Sunday all time spent by the pupils in home work
should be entered in the proper place.</p>

<p>Each Monday morning a slip filled in during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
previous week should be returned to the teacher.
This slip must be signed by the parent or guardian.</p>

<p>Extra work may be listed in the blank spaces.</p>

<p>To secure credit at school for his work, the pupil
should average eight hours a week, thirty-two
hours a month, at real, honest, helpful labor that
relieves the fathers and mothers of that amount
of work. If this is done, the teacher will add three
credits to the average gained by the pupil at the
school during the month in his studies. Additional
credits will be given for more than thirty-two
hours a month at the rate of one credit for every
ten hours' work.</p>

<p>Please co&#246;perate with your teacher in this plan
for making work more worth while to the boy and
girl.</p>

<p>In the District 61 School, near Bellingham,
Washington, taught by Mrs. Lou Albee
Maynard, there is used a system of having
the home credit accounts kept by pupils; the
children call it the Ruth and Grace System.</p>

<p>Here is a plan that solves the problem, if
it is a problem, of putting extra work on the
teacher through home credits. Not only is the
teacher entirely relieved of the bookkeeping
which the system requires, but the pupils are
engaged in practical bookkeeping while they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
keep the records. Checks are made out in regular
bank-check form, and receipts are given.</p>

<p>The Ruth and Grace System is thus described
in a neat account written by Emma
Ames, a pupil in the sixth grade:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ruth and Grace were girls who wanted to learn
bookkeeping. In order to give them a chance we
took up the credit system.</p>

<p>At the end of each week the girls give us a slip
of paper ruled and ready to be made out. The
mothers sign it. Each thing which we do counts
so much. At the end of the week these slips are
handed back to the girls, and we receive another.
We also get a check telling how many credits we
received the week before.</p>

<p>When we make five thousand credits we then
receive a composition book. Smaller things are
also given for fewer credits.</p>

<p>The girls keep in their ledgers each person's
work. So if any mistake is made they will have
something to refer to.</p>

<p>We call the system the Ruth and Grace System.</p>

<p>The prize list is as follows:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>The following letter from Mrs. Maynard
explains the system further:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have been requested to report on our plan for
giving credit for home work as we have tried it.
One of my pupils has written a report of our system
which explains our methods nicely. This has been
only a trial, but I am so pleased with results that
I intend to use it whenever there are older pupils
who can do the bookkeeping, for it represents a
great deal of work, and unless the school is a very
small one the system would add too much to the
already busy teacher's work.</p>

<p>The girls who are represented by our firm carried
on the work on a strictly business basis. They
bought the work of the pupils as represented by
the weekly reports. This work was then sold to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
me at a gain of 20 per cent. The girls have worked
out a simple system of double entry in six weeks.
We, as a school, have spent an interesting and
profitable time, keeping track of our work, and
of their mistakes, and the various ups and downs
of a business.</p>

<p>We are planning a better schedule of wages, a
bank in which to deposit our checks, and a store
where the credits may be exchanged for little
articles which represent the rewards; but this is
all in the making, and may have to wait for
another year, as our school term closes soon.</p>

<p>This is a school whose average attendance is
about sixteen. The people are progressive, and
see that we have all modern appliances: gymnasium,
school garden, bubbling fountain, sanitary
toilets, and a good heating system are some of the
good things our country school enjoys.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some original features are included in a
plan in operation in Algona, King County,
Washington. The Algona plan of grading is
this: The actual number of minutes employed
in doing the daily chores is registered. Thirty
minutes is allowed for church attendance.
Twenty-five per cent is given weekly for each
of the personal care items, bathing, brushing
teeth, sleeping with open windows, and going
to bed before nine o'clock. Half an hour's
work must be done each day, else the pupil
forfeits the work done that day. If at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of a month the pupil has made an average of
85 per cent on personal care, and has 85 per
cent on home work, his grade average for the
month is raised 10 per cent. For instance, if
a boy should have the required 85 per cent in
the home credit department, and should have
an average of 80 per cent in his school subjects,
his final grade for the month would be
88 per cent.</p>

<p>Algona uses a book system of keeping the
pupils' weekly home credit grades. The principal
records the final grades for each week,
after collecting the cards from his three assistants.
He expects to substitute the card system
for the book another year, using the same
plan of record. Below is given the plan for
keeping the records, together with the work
of one boy for a month:&mdash;</p>

<p>A comparison of Leon Noel's home credit
record on his slip with the record in the principal's
book shows that while he has 405
credits on the former he is credited with only
the required 210 on the record. C. C. Calavan,
the principal, expects to allow a holiday,
or grant additional credit on school work
another year, for credits above the half-hour
a day. The children of the school at first
insisted on making an hour's work the minimum
for a day's credit, but Mr. Calavan
decided to start conservatively. It will be
noticed that Leon Noel lost three points in
each of the last two weeks of February. This
was because he was not in bed before nine
every evening. Mr. Calavan says he is going
to change his plan along this line next year,
granting three or four evenings a month when
a child may be in bed a little later than nine
without forfeiting credits. He believes that
a happy, wholesome evening, spent in play
with companions, has a very valuable place
in the child's development.</p>

<p>Sunday-school and church attendance has
become popular in Algona since school credit
has been given for it. The little daughter in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
non-church-going family had never attended
any church services until it was brought out
that the other children at school were getting
credit for such attendance. The parents
dressed the little girl for Sunday school, and
sent her off, determined that their child
should not be left out in the home credit
game.</p>

<p>A boy's record was perfect, except that he
did not have a church attendance recorded.
On inquiry the principal found that Albert's
family was of the Seventh Day Adventist
faith, and that the boy was at church as
regularly as Saturday came. He was at once
given credit. The children of the Catholic
faith are given credit for attending the
catechism class that meets in the schoolhouse
Tuesday afternoons.</p>

<p>"The people took hold," said Mr. Calavan.
"The Parent-Teachers' Association is enthusiastic
over the plan, and is doing all possible
to help. Two decided results that home
credits have brought about are that we have
a much neater, better-kept class of pupils,
and our boys are off the streets. Several
persons have remarked to me that the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
was doing something with the boys, surely,
for they all seemed to be busy after school."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The system introduced in Portland, Oregon,
schools, is the daily record and weekly report
plan. The following suggestions were sent
out early in 1914 by the Portland office:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Suggestions for using the "Home Record Slip"</em></p>

<p>The regular monthly report card should contain
two extra columns, one entitled "Home Work"
and one "Personal Care," and in these columns
the pupil should be marked on the scale of 100.</p>

<p>One hundred per cent in the "Home Work"
column would be secured by a daily record of not
less than one half-hour of approved work for seven
days each week.</p>

<p>One hundred per cent in the "Personal Care"
column would be secured by daily practice of
numbers A, B, C, and D for seven days of the
week, and for attendance upon some religious
service. Twenty per cent could be allowed for
each number and twenty per cent for attendance
at church or Sunday school.</p>

<p>The matter of bathing should not be interpreted
to refer strictly to tub baths, since in large families
daily tub baths are sometimes impracticable, and
inability to make a good showing on the card
would have a tendency to discourage.</p>

<p>Different plans of reward for a given number of
minutes devoted to work during a week are outlined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in the pamphlet, "School Industrial Credit
for Home Industrial Work." These, however,
may be modified or enlarged to suit. All time,
including the half-hour a day and the amount
allowed for all other operations, should be counted
toward a specified total necessary to earn the
reward.</p></blockquote>

<p>These rules are printed on the back of each
home credit record card:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Rules governing Credit for Home Work</em></p>

<p>Every Friday afternoon a home work record
slip will be given to each pupil. Beginning with
Sunday, all time spent by the pupil in home
work should be entered in the proper space.</p>

<p>Each Monday morning a slip filled during the
previous week should be returned to the teacher.
The slip must be signed by the parent or guardian
as an assurance that a correct record has been kept.</p>

<p>Any work not listed but of value to the parents
may be counted, and the nature of the work specified
in the blank spaces.</p>

<p>At the close of the school month, when the
report of school work is made out, in the column
"Home Work," the pupil will be marked on the
scale of 100 for actual work of not less than one
half-hour each day, and in the column "Personal
Care" on the scale of 100 for numbers A, B, C, and
D, and for attendance at church or Sunday school.</p>

<p>In addition to credit on the report card, reward
may be given at the option of the principal for a
specified amount of time spent in useful work at
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>For purpose of reward credit of five minutes a
day will be allowed for each operation listed as
A, B, C, and D, and twenty minutes for attendance
at church or Sunday school.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Portland home work record slips are
printed by the city office, and furnished to
teachers who wish to use them. On pages 115,
117, and 119 are given home credit records
of Portland children, showing the class of
home work they are doing. A swift review
of a child's record gives the teacher a pretty
accurate estimate of his home environment.</p>

<p>Elsie G., whose card is shown, has kept
weekly records of her work for more than a
year. She and some of the other girls make it
a practice to help Miss Wright, their teacher,
enroll the records for the class. The method of
crediting is extremely simple, but it seems to
work. The pupils return the filled-out slips the
first of every week; at the end of each month
the girls count the slips, and for every pupil
who has brought in four slips they register one
credit in the book. Miss Wright looks over the
cards as they come in, and often makes comment
on the work, to the individual, or to the
class as a whole.</p>

<p>Miss Wright began this home credit work
by taking sixteen of the printed slips and laying
them on her desk. The boys left the room
to go to manual training, and the girls then
gathered around her desk and discovered the
slips. "What are these?" they inquired, and
they each wanted one to take home. There
were just enough for the girls, but when the
boys found out about it they clamored for
slips, too.</p>

<p>Miss Wright now leaves a pile of the blanks
on her desk every Friday, and most of the
pupils take them. They used to ask to have
the credit applied to raise their standings on
their lowest studies (they are allowed, for instance,
to increase a mark of seven in grammar
to a mark of eight for one month), but now
they seldom ask for the increase. They do
their home work and record it with no other
incentive than the satisfaction of having a
record and the honor and approval of their
parents, teacher, and schoolmates.</p>

<p>The ten-year-old boy whose card is shown
here goes on week-ends to the country, and
brings in his record afterward with great pride
to show the other fellows that he has cared for
horses.</p>

<p>We find many instances, like the following,
where boys who at first had nothing to do,
seemingly, but to get in the fuel, have begun
to assist their mothers with the dishwashing,
dusting, and cooking. Not only does this
work run up their list of credits at school,
but it causes them to appreciate what mother
has to do, gets them acquainted with their
homes, and keeps them off the streets.</p>

<p>And it has other uses for a boy. Henry
Turner Bailey says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Away from home, as a lonely art student and
young teacher in strange and home-sickening
boarding houses, maybe I wasn't thankful to be
able to sweep and dust, to wash and iron and cook,
upon occasion, to sew on buttons, to darn, and to
mend. But perhaps my keenest satisfaction came
from my ability to make a bed. The boarding-house
madonnas are not, as a rule, highly skilled
in that gentle art.</p>

<p>In view of my personal experiences I have often
wondered why the advocates of Domestic Science
are not more strongly co-educational. What is
sauce for the goose seems to me worthy to be sauce
for the gander,&mdash;certainly during the gosling
stage. Every boy should know how to sew, just as
every girl should know how to whittle. Every boy
should know how to cook, just as every girl should
know how to swim. Skill in the elemental arts is a
form of what Henderson calls human wealth. All
should participate.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A Portland woman, who is much interested
in the schools, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In looking over some of the cards I find that the
child soon learns to do his "chores" in less time
each week, that he may have more time for other
work or play, and yet fill out his record card. This
is a great help to the parents.</p>

<p>I know one boy who cannot be induced to go
out to an evening affair because he wants to get to
bed before nine o'clock so that his record card will
be perfect. How soon could we dismiss the Juvenile
Court if we could get all children to feel like
that! It is worth while to try.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Polk County, Oregon, the system has
been introduced into rural schools with
marked success. The plan here comprises a
daily record, and monthly reports. Below are
excerpts from an article written for the
<cite>Oregon Teachers' Monthly</cite>, by Mr. R. G.
Dykstra, who used home credits in his rural
school at Suver, Polk County, in 1912-13.
I should like to direct especial attention to his
testimony on the tardiness record of the district;
also to his plan of allowing credit for a
long walk to school.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>With the following exceptions I carried out the
work as started in the Spring Valley School last
year: I required the pupils to get eight hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
minutes' credit before taking the holiday instead
of six hundred; the number of minutes' credit for
milking cows was increased from five to fifteen for
each cow and a reasonable amount of credit was
allowed for all work not named in the list of chores;
children living over a mile and a half from school
were allowed credit for the distance they had to
walk in proportion to the others, and 5 per cent
instead of 10 was added to the end of the year on
their final school averages for the carrying on of
the work. Only two prizes were offered by the
District, three dollars and two dollars respectively.
Children seldom took advantage of the holiday
given for eight hundred minutes' credit unless it
was used for sickness or unavoidable absence, as
they were encouraged in the knowledge that a
day lost was a day's work lost as well. Tardiness
on the part of any pupil doing the work meant a
loss of so many credits already accumulated.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to enumerate the many
things this work has done for this community,
but the following facts may prove interesting to
the reader. During the year of 1911-12, without
home credit work, this school had a record of 95
per cent in attendance and 59 tardies. For the
year 1912-13 just closed, the record is 98 per cent
in attendance and 8 tardies. Part of the home
credits given have been for proper care of body,
sleeping with windows open, care of teeth, hair,
etc., and the result of these requirements has been
the showing of a healthier appearance on the part
of nearly all the pupils. The parents of the district
claim that the children are doing more work at
home than they ever did before, and the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
feel that their children are getting an education
that will be of value to them and that the money
is being well spent in this kind of work.</p></blockquote>

<p>The card issued by County Superintendent
Seymour is here reproduced filled out by a
pupil. It shows daily records for two weeks
on each side of the card. The five school days
only are counted.</p>

<p>The card given on pages 122 and 123 came
from Miss Veva Burns, the teacher at North
Dallas, with the following letter, dated April
26, 1914:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am pleased to explain the home credit system
as we use it. I am sending some of the cards filled
out by the pupils. We secure these cards from Mr.
Seymour, the county school superintendent, and
are allowed to use them as we think best....</p>

<p>We have a two-room school, and have divided
it into two divisions, the smaller pupils having
five thousand credits as their aim, while the larger
ones work for ten thousand. Of course the number
to be obtained would vary with the opportunity
the children would have to earn credits. On the
average, it takes our pupils about three months
to earn the required number. When they have
secured the number, some prize, such as a book, is
given, and they are allowed to start again. Then,
at the end of school, the one who has earned the
most is given a special prize. Also, Mr. Seymour
allows us to give ten points on each child's lowest
grade, at the close of school, if he has kept up his
home credit work during the school year. Some
teachers give a holiday as a reward instead of a
prize.</p>

<p>The cards are taken home by the pupils and
filled out each evening. If the pupils are too small
to attend to the cards, some member of the family
looks after them. We see to it that the system is
thoroughly understood by each family. As each
card is filled out, it is returned to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>We have a school of over sixty pupils, and all
but four are working on the credit system. We did
not urge any one to take it up, but allowed them
to decide for themselves.</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter is from Miss Miriam H. Rarey,
who has taught near Dallas, in 1914:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Work done on Saturdays and Sundays does not
count with the exception of bathing. Pupils, as a
rule, when they bathe at all, bathe on Saturday.
So I told them they could take thirty minutes'
credit for that, and put it down in Friday's space,
in the hope that it would induce them to bathe
at least once a week. It worked pretty well with
some of the pupils, but others would rather do
without the credits than do anything so unusual.
When a pupil gets five thousand credits (every
minute counts one credit) he gets his grade on his
poorest study raised 5 per cent, or if he does not
need that, he gets a holiday without being marked
absent. The pupils have all worked pretty hard
for credits, and only a few have asked for holidays.
The people in the district have all been pleased
with the results of home credit and I think it is a
good thing. I have seventeen pupils, and they
are all using home credits.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Idaho plan as sent out by the State
Superintendent, Miss Grace M. Shepherd,
in a bulletin to teachers is as follows: Miss
Shepherd issued two mimeographed sheets,
one of rules, and one a list of credits. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
blank has a place for a daily record and a
report for several weeks.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Rules governing Home Work</em></p>

<p>1. No pupil is obliged to enter the contest.</p>

<p>2. Parent must sign statement of work done by
pupil.</p>

<p>3. Contest closes when school term closes.</p>

<p>4. Unexcused absence forfeits all credits. Unexcused
tardiness forfeits 25 per cent of credits
per month. Less than 90 per cent deportment,
20 per cent of all credits forfeited.</p>

<p>5. Suggested awards:</p>

<p>Names of the six highest at the close of
school will be published in a county paper.</p>

<p>Three highest at the close of school to be
offered prize by the School Board or some
citizen.</p>

<p>Five per cent credit to be added to final
examination results of all pupils who enter
and continue in the contest.</p>

<p>In Charleston, Washington, Superintendent
H. W. Elliott, of the city schools, put into
successful operation, in 1913-14, a plan with
several special features, to which I am glad
to call attention. The plan comprises daily
markings by the tally system, monthly
reports, cash prizes to those showing the
largest number of home credits, and some
reward to every pupil with credits above a
certain specified number. For the purpose of
raising a fund to meet the cash prizes, his
school gave a play; and an autumn fair, in
October, was arranged for the distribution of
the prizes for both school and home work.
The credit card is different from any other;
it seems to be the most simple of all the
monthly systems.</p>

<p>Mr. Elliott writes: "I believe there is
nothing that will link the home and school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
more closely than the system of credits.
There is one danger, however, of cultivating
dishonesty on the part of the over-anxious
one. This we watch, but this tendency is
sometimes noticeable. Occasionally we find
a youngster attending Sunday school or
church fifteen or twenty times a month."</p>

<p>Examples of the scheme of a weekly record
with monthly report are plans in operation
in Jackson County, and in Weston, Umatilla
County, Oregon. The rules and schedule following
were published by Mr. J. Percy Wells,
county superintendent of Jackson County.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Rules governing Home Credit Work</em></p>

<p>1. No pupil shall be required to enter the home
credit contest, and any pupil shall be free to
quit the contest at any time, but if any one
quits without good cause, all credits earned
shall be forfeited.</p>

<p>2. Once each month the parent or guardian shall
send to the teacher, with signature affixed,
an itemized statement containing a record of
the work each child has done during the preceding
month. The child may make out the
list, but the parent or guardian must sign
the same.</p>

<p>3. At the end of each school month the teacher
shall enter on the pupil's report card the
total number of credits for home work during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the month, as certified to by the parent or
guardian.</p>

<p>4. Any pupil who has earned at least two hundred
credits for home work during any school
month shall be entitled to have 10 per cent
added to his grade in any subject, or distributed
among several subjects, and 1 per cent
additional for each twenty additional credits
up to four hundred credits.</p>

<p>5. All pupils who shall have earned four hundred
credits or more during any month shall
be entitled to a half-holiday, and shall have
their names entered on a roll of honor.</p>

<p>6. Forfeitures&mdash;Dropping out of contest without
cause, all credits earned; unexcused
absence, all credits due; unexcused tardiness,
25 per cent off all credits due; less than 90
per cent in deportment for any month, 10
per cent off all credits due.</p>

<p>These rules may be modified by teachers
to suit local conditions. If the half-holiday
system of awards is not satisfactory, some
other system may be substituted.</p>

<p class="center"><em>To parents and guardians</em>:</p>

<p>In this plan for giving school credit for
home work it is not the intention of the
school to intrude upon the domain of the
home, but to co&#246;perate with the home in the
interest of the boys and girls. Here is a splendid
chance for the school and the home to
come closer together, and we believe both
will be improved thereby.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following letter, dated April 20, 1914,
is from Mrs. Bertha McKinney, of a district
near Ashland, Jackson County.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Pupils of the first, second, and third grades, who
have earned two hundred credits in a month have
a half-holiday. Those of the fourth, fifth, and sixth
grades must have earned three hundred credits to
entitle them to the half-holiday, and of the seventh,
eighth, and ninth grades, four hundred credits.
When all have the required number of credits, all
have the half-holiday. I have twenty pupils, and
all are doing the home credit work. I keep the
record of the credits earned in a notebook, and
place the number earned by each pupil on the
monthly report card. I think the plan a good one,
though in a few cases the parents are not careful
enough with their part; that is, they sign the
blank form, then the child can put down any
number he pleases. I have had only one such case.</p></blockquote>

<p>Superintendent Joel O. Davis, of Weston,
tells of the manner in which his school began
to use home credits:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The opportunity came in October of last year,
when an unexpected influx of pupils made it
necessary for us to engage an extra teacher and
adopt a departmental plan for the fifth to eighth
grades inclusive. This made it necessary for those
grades to prepare two lessons at home, thus making
the required home reading a burden. I at once
offered these students the choice of reading the
required books, and writing the reviews, or making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the points by home work, under the conditions
as shown by the accompanying card. Nearly every
child accepted the home work plan, and went to
work enthusiastically.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the opposite page is one of the Weston
credit cards, filled out by a pupil, Crete
Allen:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Home Work Record, Weston Public School</em></p>

<p>Credits will be given for the performance of the following
named duties when this card is returned, at the end of the
month, properly signed by the parent or guardian.</p>

<p>These credits will be accepted in place of the home reading
heretofore required, at the rate of 100 points for each book.</p>

<p>The parent must check the work each day as performed.</p>

<p>Any evasion or falsification of the record will forfeit all claim
to credit.</p>

<p>To obtain credit each duty must be performed by the child
unaided by others, and must be well and satisfactorily done.</p>

<p>No credit will be given for work that is paid for by the
parent or others.</p>

<p>Parents are requested to see that the above conditions are
complied with and to encourage thoroughness and truthfulness
by using care in recording so as to give no unearned
credits.</p>

<p>Make one mark, and only one, for each duty each day.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

No. 14 includes general tidiness, hanging hat and coat, putting<br />
away clothes, shoes, stockings, etc., and will be given<br />
more credit than any other one duty. Parents should use care<br />

<p>At the close of a later letter Mr. Davis
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From my experience with this experiment I feel
that the plan is worth all it costs and more, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
should be extended to include all the grades, that
modifications to meet the needs of different communities
can easily be made, and that the pupils
and patrons of any district will appreciate and
support some such plan if it is carried out faithfully.
I kept a ledger account with every child,
and at the end of the month posted a bulletin
exhibiting the condition of each pupil's account.
The interest was shown by the manner in which
they gathered about the board and compared their
credits. Some of the comments upon some lazy
boy's or girl's lack of effort were rather caustic,
but served as effective spurs to the delinquent.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Pend Oreille County, Washington, six
weeks is the unit of time for credit records.

has issued the following circular:&mdash;</p>

SCHOOL CREDIT FOR HOME WORK</small></p>

<p>In order that the school and home may unite
forces, that the school may help in establishing
habits of home-making, and that our boys and
girls may be taught that their parents are their
best friends and need their help, the following
system of credits has been devised for use in the
schools of Pend Oreille County.</p>

<p><br />The city of Los Angeles, California, uses a
plan of marking home work on the report card
and giving no other incentive. Notice that a
certain number of minutes daily for ten weeks
is the unit, and that the number of minutes
varies according to the age of the child. Observe
the emphasis on care of yards and streets,
also on care of little brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>The Committee on Home Credits makes these
recommendations:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. That the "Home Credits" be not used as a
substitute for other work, and also that they
be not applied to increase the grade of other
subjects except as any work well done necessarily
improves all work of the child.</p>

<p>2. That the words "Home Credit" be written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
on the new cards just published, and that in
the future these words be printed as a regular
part of the card, with space for inserting the
number of credits.</p>

<p>3. That in the several grades the following constitute
one credit:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>a</em>) First and second grades, 10 minutes of
daily work for 10 weeks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>b</em>) Third and fourth grades, 15 minutes of
daily work for 10 weeks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>c</em>) Fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades,
20 minutes of daily work for 10 weeks, and
that multiples of such work in 10, 15, 20
minutes be allowed so that a child may earn
several credits each ten weeks.</p>

the initial trial of the plan:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><br />WEEKLY RECORDS, THREE OR MORE
MONTHS' REPORTS</p>

<p>Mr. F. W. Simmonds, superintendent of
city schools, Lewiston, Idaho, has instituted
a plan for daily and weekly records with a
report for three months, which he writes is
"working out most successfully." The statement
of his particular scheme which he gives
in his home credit record folder is accompanied
by an excellent presentation of the nature and
scope of the home credit plan in general:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>A Plan for School and Home Co&#246;peration</em></p>

<p>One of the vital problems of school administration
to-day is that of securing closer co&#246;peration
between school and home life. When the child
learns that <em>education is living and working the best
way</em> he has made considerable progress on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
educational road. Our school curriculum should
encourage this wholesome attitude toward the
everyday tasks.</p>

<p>Children must have time for real play and plenty
of it, but let us not forget that real work is also a
part of the child's rightful heritage, and that when
rightly directed, children like to work&mdash;they are
eager to take part in some of the real activities
of life. However, they must not be permitted to
attempt too much&mdash;a reasonable amount of <em>work
well done regularly</em> and suited to the child's age and
ability is what is desired.</p>

<p><em>Filling out this card is optional with the parent</em>, no
grade on the quality of the work done by the child
is asked for, merely the approximate time regularly
devoted to that task. Note the time; one
half-hour, one hour, two hours, etc., in the proper
column on this card. Your filling out and signing
this card will assure us that the work was well done,
regularly and satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The work may include any one or more of the
multitude of home tasks, or any work done regularly,
as sewing, ironing, washing dishes, preparing
meals, baking, cutting kindling, gardening, milking,
caring for poultry, feeding stock, making beds,
music lessons, tending furnace, etc.</p>

<p>Some tasks occur daily (others weekly, as regular
Saturday chores, music lessons and the like).
Nothing less than a <em>half-hour</em> is to be recognized,
though two or more tasks may be grouped to make
a half-hour daily or weekly. The average child
will be anxious to figure his home service in the
large; but a reasonably conservative "statement
of account" will have a greater disciplinary value,
and will make for efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>unit</em> of home credit will be <em>one half-hour's
daily work throughout the month</em>. Time spent on
regular weekly tasks will be adjusted by the
teacher to this basis. If the work in quantity,
quality and regularity is deemed worthy, the
teacher will credit the pupil with the number of
home credits earned, which will be added to the
pupil's standing at the end of the semester in
determining promotion. Each <em>unit</em> of credit in
home work will have the effect of raising a monthly
grade in some subject one step as from <em>poor</em> to <em>fair</em>,
or <em>fair</em> to <em>good</em>, etc. By means of home credits, a
pupil has an opportunity to raise his promotion
standing to "Promoted with Honor," or "Promoted
with Highest Honors" as the case may be,
if he should lack a point or two, and have earned
enough home credits to offset this.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the Borough of the Bronx in New York
City, Mr. Frederick J. Reilly began to give
school credit for home work in the fall of 1914.
He issues two cards of different colors, one for
the girls and one for the boys. The cards are
alike except for the words "he" and "she."
Notice that the cards are well planned for use
in city homes. At present they are used by
the children of seventh and eighth grades.
Mr. Reilly says, "The important thing is not
the amount of credit the child receives in
school, but rather the amount of influence this
may have upon the training of the child at
home."</p>

<p>Superintendent E. B. Conklin, of Ontario,
Malheur County, in 1912, was the next in
Oregon after Mr. O'Reilly to send a letter to
parents, and to arrange for giving credits on
home work. On page 149 are the inside pages
of the folder that Mr. Conklin devised; it
was the first of the printed home credit report
cards. Notice the entries of manners,
of "doing before told," and of "kindness to
animals."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. E. G. Bailey, superintendent of Ontario,
1913-14, writes that they have been
using home credits continuously there, and
that the system has proved to be a wonderful
help. "It gets parents and teachers together
as nothing else can, and gives the superintendent
a show. The home work is to the
teacher what the school work is to the parent.
The teacher is enabled to get an insight into
the home life of the pupil, which in turn
enables her the better to deal with whatever
situation may arise. In the main the parents
make an effort to let the teacher know what
the pupils are doing at home. We have very
few failures from parents not doing their duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
in this matter; where they fail, we refuse to
send any report home. Since adopting the
system our attendance has been better, and
the punctuality has been better; in fact,
things have been greatly improved in every
respect."</p>

<p>Early in December, 1913, a large meeting
in the interest of social center work was held
in Roslyn, Washington. At this meeting the
city superintendent, Linden McCullough,
explained the school credit for home work
idea. He advised that a vote be taken as to
whether the schools of that town should
adopt the plan. The vote showed that parents,
teachers, and pupils were enthusiastic
over the idea and eager to try it. The
Woman's Club of the city volunteered to
assist in every possible way. The following
from letters from Mr. McCullough gives the
result of the trial:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Seventy-five per cent of our seven hundred and
fifty pupils are taking advantage of the scheme.
Our truant officer says that every parent he has
talked with has praised the plan, for the reason
that all the children do their chores with more
spirit. Our police officers have noticed a falling-off
in the number of children on the streets; so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
so that juvenile court cases are much fewer in
number. The teachers notice an improvement in
school work along all lines.</p>

<p>One boy in the fourth grade who was disagreeably
indifferent about his personal care now takes
baths regularly, and always brushes his hair, and
keeps his clothing clean and neat. Roslyn has a
large number of foreign people. Teachers in the
first three grades say that parents of foreign children
do not grasp the idea very well, but that
older brothers and sisters explain its workings,
and attend to keeping tab on the reports of the
little children.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the next two pages is a copy of the
Roslyn folder. Notice the entries of mending,
cleaning yard, putting away playthings, work
done for wages, work "in father's place of
business," home study (school work), and
reading good books.</p>

<p>In Wilbur, Washington, a scheme providing

successful operation. Here Superintendent
E. O. McCormick carries on the plan by

the school to the home, the other from the
home to the school, every six weeks. The
home card is reproduced below.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Sterling, of Clarke County,
Washington, was one of the first county superintendents
to get out a card suitable for use
throughout her schools. She strongly urged
the teachers of her county to try the plan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and in 1914 eighty-five teachers were operating
it. This card provides a record for the
whole school year, with a general average for
the nine months. To secure credit the pupil
is required to average eight hours per week,
or thirty-two hours per month, at "real honest,
helpful labor that relieves the father and
mother of that amount of work." This done,
the teacher is to add three credits to the
average gained by the pupil at the school
during the month of his or her studies. Additional
credits are to be given for more than
thirty-two hours per month at the rate of one
credit for every ten hours' work. The parent
or guardian is cautioned to keep track of the
number of hours that the boy or girl actually
spends per week at any of the kinds of work
named on the credit report card, or any other
real work that is not there listed. The printed
list comprises:&mdash;</p>

<h3>HOME CREDIT IN HIGH SCHOOLS</h3>


<p>Several high schools have sent us reports
of their plans for giving credit for work outside
of school. Some of these schools use
plans that differ considerably from those of the
elementary schools where the movement began;
they lay emphasis on improvement in
work, and to this end they require that all
the work be supervised by the teachers of
home economics, agriculture, commerce, or
manual training. Other high schools try to
encourage the habit of industry, no matter
what the kind of work, and offer credit for
such tasks as running errands, delivering
groceries, or carrying a paper route. In my
opinion both ideas are good; there is no end
to the possibilities of developing skill in home
work under the instruction of one who really
knows how to do it, and there is also great
value in the encouragement of faithful industry
in routine tasks.</p>

<p>The list of credits is divided into two parts,
outside work and home work. Among the
many outside activities mentioned in the St.

<p>The Ames, Iowa, High School course outlines
out-of-school work in three departments:
agriculture, manual training, and home economics.
I quote from the home economics
prospectus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Unless the work is ... made to connect with the work
in the home it loses much of its vitality. Our aim is to
relate the home and the school and permit each to
contribute its share in making the work vital, really
worth while. The girl ... may carry into the home some
new ways of working, and there will be an exchange of
ideas between mother and daughter as to hows and
whys ... that will result beneficially to both. As the
girl carries these ideas and discoveries back into the
school we shall be able to know better the needs of home
and social life, and hence so plan our work that it may
"carry over" into her out-of-school life.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>A total of two credits to apply on graduation
may be earned in home economics at the
Ames High School. Three hundred points
equal one credit.</p>

<p>Two hundred points each are offered for
cookery, general housework and sewing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Cooking is to be done for the family at home, and
whenever possible a sample brought to the school for
examination, together with the recipes giving itemized
cost, and a signed statement that the entire work was
done by the girl herself. A list of things to be cooked
is given: ten dishes are required, the other five are to
be chosen from the list. The list for the first year follows;
dishes required are marked with a star and receive
seven points credit, the others receive six points.</p>

<p>The High School at North Yakima, Washington,
gives credit for work in music under
approved teachers; for practice-teaching
(coaching) by normal students in the grades;
and for work in agriculture.</p>

<p>The summer work in agriculture is planned
before the close of the school in the spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Each pupil informs the instructor in agriculture
as to the kind of work he intends to do.
The instructor visits each pupil several times
during the summer, discussing methods of
work, results, etc., with him and his employer,
and designating pamphlets, bulletins, and magazine
articles for him to read. In 1914, fifty-four
pupils applied for credit for work in
agriculture.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Rules for Summer Agricultural Work in
North Yakima, Washington</em></p>

<p>1. Students may earn one credit in agriculture toward
graduation by work completed outside of school
during the vacation period.</p>

<p>2. At least 250 hours of work must be completed
before any credit will be given.</p>

<p>3. Complete records and systematic reports kept by
the applicant, giving all information required,
and signed by the parent or employer, shall be
filed with the instructor in agriculture every two
weeks.</p>

<p>4. Applicants shall secure such information as a
result of reading, study, and questioning experienced
workers, as may be necessary to convince
the instructor in charge that the work has been
of sufficient educational value to justify the granting

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<h3>KANSAS AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE
BULLETIN</h3>


<p>Mr. John C. Werner, of the college extension
division of the Kansas State Agricultural College,
wrote in 1914 a very valuable bulletin entitled
"School Credit for Home Work," the essential
features of which are given.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Notice that he recommends
that pupils furnish the reports themselves
over their own signatures, as putting them
on their honor is considered valuable, and in justice
due them.</p>

<p>In a letter Mr. Werner says: "My idea of giving
credit is to use the old laboratory method of requiring
the student to do a reasonable amount of
work in a reasonable length of time. This allows
for many of the variable factors that enter into the
problem; I think it is better than to give so many
points of credit for each piece of work done."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the first six grades of the elementary school, where
so much depends upon using the child's knowledge
which he has gained from actual experiences about
home, and the environment with which he comes in
contact which is really a part of himself, we have the
best basis for his further education. In these grades it
will be raising and not lowering our standards when we
give credit for home work and add it to the school
credits for passing grades. All of the subjects of these
grades should be so closely affiliated with the home life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of the child as to warrant our doing this. It is so important
that the child be engaged in the actual doing of
things that the perfect grade of 100 per cent should be
divided into two divisions: (1) A maximum of 90 per
cent for school work. (2) A maximum of 10 per cent
for home work when proper records and reports are kept.</p>

<p>In the seventh and eighth grades and in the high
school, work corresponding to the age and ability of the
pupils should be introduced and made part of the laboratory
work, giving two fifths of a unit of credit. Here
written reports of the operations performed should be
worked out by the pupils and presented as class work.
Classes should visit the dairy barns, feeding pens, gardens,
corn or grass fields, orchards, etc. Pupils should
carry on considerable individual home work, which
should continue throughout the summer as well as winter
season. This credit should be counted in agriculture,
domestic arts and manual-training courses.</p>

<p>The various contests among the boys and girls, that
are conducted in all parts of the state, certainly should
be counted worthy of school credit. These contests are
directly or indirectly under the auspices of the Agricultural
College, and numerous bulletins are sent to the
contestants. Many children actually receive in these
contests almost the equal of a year's course in school.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Plan for Allowing Credit</em></p>

<p>It is absolutely essential in taking up this work that
the teacher make a careful survey in her neighborhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of the kinds of home work that the pupils have opportunity
to do. The pupils should be put on their honor in
reporting their work, and the teacher must work out
the amount of credit time the various items are to
receive, and from the pupils' reports grade the work.
A large number of items should be included and given
their relative weight. Quality as well as quantity must
be judged by the teacher. This supplies a working
basis for co&#246;peration between home and school.</p>

<p>Besides the credits earned in the particular subjects
of agriculture, domestic arts and manual training, where
216 hours will add two fifths of a unit, other work may
be given some additional credit up to say 10 per cent,
as physiology and geography. It is also possible that
subjects such as English and arithmetic may be so correlated
as to be at least partially considered in connection
with the agriculture, domestic arts, and manual
training by the composition required and the problems
furnished.</p>

<p>It is not expected that any boy or girl will enter all of
the contests. Contests which require 216 hours' work
should be given two fifths of a unit credit in the subject
to which it belongs. If the child in the contest is below
the seventh grade, the work should add to his entire
school grade up to 10 per cent. The fairness of this plan
will appeal to the boys and girls, for the girl or boy who
has third, fourth or fifth place in the contest deserves
credit as well as the one who wins first place.</p>

<p>It is the object in the credit for home work both to
recognize and give credit because of the educational
value to the child of such work which he does with his
hands, and it is also hoped to develop the child into a
better worker, so that the work performed will be constantly
of a higher order as the child grows older. In
other words, we have a constantly changing variable
as the child grows older as to the time necessary to do
certain work, and the proficiency with which the work
is done. Speed in doing things is not the only consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and yet all work should be done with reasonable
dispatch.</p>

<p>In inaugurating this work it seems that the ordinary
laboratory method for giving credit is quite as well
adapted to home laboratory work as it is to school
laboratory work. If the perfect grade, 100 per cent in
the elementary school in grades 1 to 6, inclusive, be
divided into two parts, i.e., a maximum of 90 per cent
for school work and a maximum of 10 per cent for home
work for all pupils who desire to do the home work,
then one tenth of the number of hours in the school year
may be taken as the basis for credit. Counting the
double period, as should be done, 216 hours or 6 hours
per week would be the required time for the nine-months'
term of school to receive full credit. The pupil
would, therefore, need to work at home six hours per
week. This work should be scattered throughout the
week as evenly as possible, with the opportunity of
doing not to exceed three hours' work in any one day,
as, for example, on Saturday. As in the laboratory
system, the pupils, regardless of the overtime put in,
could only receive full credit for any year. Pupils who
do not have the chance for home work will not be
affected in their work, as the usual method of grading
will apply to them. Conditions must determine the
time necessary for any given piece of work. For example,
if one boy feeds a team of horses in ten minutes,
another in fifteen minutes, another in five minutes, and
another in thirty minutes, under similar conditions,
perhaps one boy is working too rapidly and another too
slowly. From such reports it seems that twelve to fifteen
minutes should be allowed for feeding a team of horses.</p>

<p>The best and most profitable division of time for the
home work would be about thirty minutes, both morning
and evening, each day. During these work periods
different things should be done, and during the year it is
to be hoped that a large variety of different kinds of
work may be included. If the home is in sympathy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the child's work it can help very materially in setting
tasks for the child that are of the most profitable nature.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Reports to Teachers</em></p>

<p>The pupils should furnish the reports themselves over
their own signatures for the home work. Putting them
on their own honor is valuable and in justice is due
them. Since results must be produced in most kinds of
work, the teacher can judge quite accurately as to the
value of work.</p>

<p>Credit for seventh and eighth grades and high school
grades should be allowed for efficient home work when
properly reported as laboratory requirement in agriculture,
domestic arts and manual training. In these
grades all careful, systematic work during the summer
season, as well as the regular school year, such as corn
acre, garden, potato plot, tomato, poultry, pig, canning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
sewing, cooking, and butter-making contests, should be
used for laboratory credit. Of course accurate records
of the work must be made at the time the work is performed.
Schools that have an agricultural teacher during
the entire year will directly supervise this work.
In other schools the reports will be used as part of the
next year's regular class work. Suitable report blanks
should be used by the pupils and kept in laboratory
notebook form.</p>

<p>The pupils of seventh, eighth and high-school grades
who do 216 hours of acceptable home work should be
given two fifths of a unit of credit in the subjects of
agriculture, domestic arts, or manual training. Here
again the pupil should do some different kinds of work
and make the experience somewhat varied. In the
home laboratory the teacher will determine a standard
amount of work of any kind to be performed in a given
time.</p>

<h2>CALIFORNIA REPORT ON OUTSIDE
ACTIVITIES</h2>


<p>At the January, 1914, meeting of the California
Teachers' Association the following report on
credit for work done outside of the school was
submitted by Mr. Hugh J. Baldwin:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><em>Credit for Work Done Outside of School</em></p>

<p>Fulfilling the wishes of this organization, your committee
sent communications to the heads of departments
of large manufacturing and commercial interests,
to managers of railroads and educational institutions,
requesting information on lines of work upon which you
wished a report. Not only were the circulars answered
promptly, but, in many cases, the answers were remarkable.
Some of them suggested in definite language how
outside activities might be made harmoniously supplemental
to our regular school work, better articulated
therewith than had been planned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many strong reasons were given; one of the most
potent was that the innovation would change the present
attitude of the average person towards labor&mdash;in
other words, to dignify the labor of the land, to honor
and respect the woman who can prepare nourishing
food in the kitchen or the man who can contribute to
the world's wealth from his garden.</p>

<p>Another strong thought from this compilation of
opinions resulted in the contrast between the systems
of American and German polytechnic or manual training
education. The German schools secure the co&#246;peration
of the factories and shops and stores where there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
particular industrial training given, all without cost to
state or municipality for the tuition. On the other hand,
in the United States, the only manual training that has
been attempted by the school authorities has been at
greater expense to the people.</p>

<p>In communities where there is no special educational
industrial training the subject of this committee work
is very important. "Outside Activities," or credit on
school reports for work done by school children at home,
has now a place in the course of study of San Diego
County. The plan has passed from the experimental
stage, having been given a thorough tryout in all the
schools. From all parts of the county reports have
come full of enthusiasm telling of the excellent working
of the plan. To be sure there are a few adverse reports.
We find that communities largely Mexican in complexion
evince little interest in the plan.</p></blockquote>

<p>Minor typographical errors have been corrected without note.
Irregularities and inconsistencies in the text have been retained as
printed.</p>

<p>Missing page numbers are page numbers that were not shown in the
original text.</p>

<p>The illustrations have been moved so that they do not break up
paragraphs.</p>

<p>Mismatched quotes are not fixed if it's not sufficiently clear where
the missing quote should be placed.</p>

<p>The cover for the eBook version of this book was created by the
transcriber and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>Rather than |||||, tally marks in the book are four upright bars with the fifth bar crossing the other four diagonally. See footnote 7 and pages 130 and 181.</p>

<p>In addition to obvious errors, the following changes have been made:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Page 118: the word "a" was added in the phrase: "a lonely art
     student"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Page 133: transposed words "be will" were corrected to "will be"
